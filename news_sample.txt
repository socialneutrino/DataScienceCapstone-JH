We need to be careful to distinguish how people respond to fear mongering and who is spreading the fears. If we ask why so many of us are losing sleep over dangers that are very small or unlikely, it's almost always because someone or some group is profiting or trying to profit by either selling us a product, scaring us into voting for them or against their opponent or enticing us to watch their TV program.

Red Red Wine might not have a destination-spot menu, but it's right at home in Annapolis — an upbeat and polished place to gather with friends. A more coherent wine list would help. The bulky wine book now is much too much: Baroquely written and ornately designed, it's generous to a fault with graphics and anecdotes, and impossible to look at for more than a few seconds.

When a consumer files a CSPA case, he's not just acting for himself. He steps into the shoes of the attorney general, acting on behalf of all consumers.

What Gould is saying is that in a world this over-saturated, where we are overwhelmed by either obligation or distraction, the most essential act is the emptiest, the one that forces us to face that there is nothing behind humanity's facade. "Not one of the works of art in the gallery," he says of an attack on the Tate Modern, "remotely matched the limitless potency of a terrorist bomb." And later: "To keep the world sane we depend on motive, we rely on cause and effect. Kick those props away and we see that the meaningless act is the only one that has any meaning."

Smart money can pipe down now. Days Away frontman Keith Goodwin and drummer Tim Arnold picked up a third musician — Unlikely Cowboy’s pure-voiced Daniel Schwartz — and has bounced back with a new sound. Good Old War plays acoustic folk-rock, lacing angelic multi-part harmonies over finger-picked six-string weaves and brisk country rhythms. The lyrics are pensive, lovelorn and occasionally philosophical. The melodies, more pretty than catchy, are reliably autumnal.

ø•He's already got his stolen base total into double-digits - can Starlin Castro keep up this pace? His speed skills are consistent with years past; what's different is that he's running much more frequently. While he ran less than 20% when reached first base in 2010-11, he's taking off more than 50% of the time in 2012. That rate is unsustainable, especially since his success rate (about 70%) is nothing special. Castro certainly looks like he'll beat last year's career-best total of 22 steals. But he's not going to double that number, despite his early pace.

The exhibits inside the museum are a timeline of the civil rights movement. Visitors can walk through a Birmingham city bus in use at the time that Rosa Parks refused to go to the back of the bus.

A replica of a burned Greyhound bus is next to the story of the Freedom Riders, who fought for voting rights; a replica of a jail cell is a reminder of when King was imprisoned.
Approximately 60 people gathered at the restaurant on North Main for pizza, wings and salad  and a few minutes with the candidate.

Not only was Jankalski going too fast in a six-knot zone, but, the officer discovered, the Jet Ski had the wrong kind of registration decal on its side, had no registration card on board and was not equipped with a horn or a whistle — four violations of Maryland's maritime laws, which apply equally to all vessels, no matter how small. Jankalski, who was visiting from Shrewsbury, Pa., and her uncle, Ronald Ridings, who had been waiting on a dock nearby, got off with a warning.
* When Hitchcock took over on Nov. 8, he installed a system that featured short shifts to avoid having players out on the ice too long, dragging and vulnerable. The fresher the legs the faster the tempo, and with Hitch as coach the Blues had more shifts per game than any NHL team. The same is true in the NHL postseason. The Blues have taken 1,898 shifts through four games, most among the 16 postseason teams. That's an average 474.5 shifts per game, the most by any of the 16 postseason teams. San Jose is averaging 435.8 shifts per game. On at least one occasion the Blues caught the Sharks in a long, tiring shift and it played a role in B.J. Crombeen's goal that gave the Blues a 1-0 lead in Game 4.

In large part the explanation for this wave of towers is economic. The global economy was booming by the middle of the last decade, and the biggest nations in the world have been urbanizing at an unprecedented clip. (China alone has built about half of the post-9/11 towers.) In the West, easy credit in those years helped finance scores of new skyscrapers, many filled with condominiums that their owners are still struggling to sell. Surging oil wealth has gilded skylines not just in Dubai and Abu Dhabi but in Moscow and Astana, the capital of Kazakhstan.
That didn't stop Cleveland police, however, from enforcing the 20 mph school zone speed limit at the usual dismissal time of 4 p.m. A mobile traffic camera parked in front of the emptied-out elementary nailed six drivers for speeding in a school zone that Wednesday afternoon.

Boulevard's decor and setting - the landmark 1889 Audiffred Building - references the Belle Époque era, but the interior of Prospect is bright and urbane, reflecting its location on the first floor of the new Infinity high-rise. Large windows overlook the street, adding to the urban feel.

In the film based on the Grimm fairy tale, he plays a man of the forest who puts his ax to good use and engages in fisticuffs.

A: It's all right. It's not bad. Pose was a legend while I was there. I didn't get an opportunity to play with him at Xavier, but coach Prosser and the people who coached him always talked about him. It was a great opportunity for us this year to get a guy like this. He has a lot of experience. He's a proven winner and he has come in and helped us a lot.

Numerous studies have examined the effect of maternal work on children's behavior and academic performance; others have looked at its effect on their physical and emotional health. The results of these studies have been inconsistent. Some suggest that children are more likely to have behavioral problems and suffer academically if their mothers work; others conclude that they'll be just fine.
As the water receded, the last stretch of standing water Tuesday night was the two blocks west of Guilford on Westfield.
Instead, Netflix tailors its recommendations by relying on data that users provide on their profiles, plus information about past rentals -- including whether you stopped watching a streaming video and never resumed it and the speed at which you go through rentals -- and ratings you give to movies. (The system is not as refined for Netflix's mail-only customers, as less data is available.)
What makes fear of "Brokeback" even more odd are the misconceptions that have developed among those who haven't seen the film. On top of being the favorite movie of the year of many critics, Ang Lee's film has mistakenly received a reputation as some kind of nonstop guy-on-guy sex romp.
Consumers should note that all these amounts in fortified foods pale in comparison with the quantities found naturally in fatty fish, says Susan Bowerman, assistant director of the ULCA Center for Human Nutrition.

As Westbrook has said several times already this season, there are times when groundballs find the spaces between the fielders and that's what happens "when you live and die with the groundout." That was the case in the first inning as the Brewers lurched to a 1-0 lead.

The money is collected each month by the state and distributed to the counties two months later.
When Chicago went two full days without a shooting back in January, Police Supt. Garry McCarthy, in our view, gave his department way too much credit for the brief respite from violence. Crime rates go up or down in the short run for all sorts of reasons, we wrote at the time, with the quality of police work being just one. Sure enough, shootings were up by the end of January.

SB 1 sponsor Evie Hudak, D-Westminster, points out that last year "the state spent more than $794 million on contracts with out-of-state companies," arguing that "we need to use that money to hire Colorado workers before hiring people from other states. ...

Z could play more, too, which, as Kerwin notes, would improve the free-throw percentage. The only problem is that he was unequipped to control Dwight Howard in the paint without double-team help, and Orlando had streak shooters who made the Cavs pay for leaving them.
It's an entertaining treatment of the topic, spiced with a healthy dose of skepticism.
By FIFA's count Pele scored an astounding 1,281 goals in 1,363 matches over a 21-year career. If he's lucky enough to play 21 years and continues to score at his current pace, Messi will finish with a bit more than half as many goals. (Although he is picking up the pace, going into the weekend with 59 goals and 20 assists in 52 appearances this season. And over the last three years, he's averaged a goal a game — all while playing most of his matches in Spain's La Liga, the most competitive league in the world.)

On Wednesday, the yield on Spain's 10-year government bond fell 0.7 percentage point, to 5.81%, but many fear that yields may surge as the European Central Bank has been sending mixed signals on whether it plans to revive its bond-purchase program.The ECB used the program last year to buy Spanish and Italian bonds after their yields climbed to euro-era highs, but the move has been unpopular in Germany, prompting two German ECB members to resign their posts in protest.

They're also growing accustomed to playing tight ones: 10 of their 11 playoff games have been decided by one goal, and only once has Washington scored as many as four. It's a long way from when they were winning playoff games by 4-0 or 5-3  and, incidentally, never making it beyond the second round.

I hailed his departure from MSNBC in January of 2011 because I believed with him leaving that channel, and Glenn Beck leaving Fox News, cable news TV would be a far less polarized and toxic space. The marginalization that I predicted for both, was on the money. But what a silly, silly fool I was to think cable news would get any better just because two of its most vocal and dangerous voices on the right and left were gone from their mainstream podiums.

Christie spokesman Michael Drewniak replied, “What’s wrong in these critical remarks is the built-in assumption that the governor does not care about the Highlands watershed or conservation of that area of New Jersey. That is just plain wrong. Unfortunately, there’s hardly an interest group or advocacy group that received state funding that didn’t have it cut, in some cases dramatically. These are difficult times — to put it mildly — and all funding will be reassessed and prioritized once our revenues increase, reform is put in place and we stabilize our fiscal position. We will also continue to look closely to determine whether the previous structure and roles of funded organizations were effective and efficient.”

That may seem like a strange thing to say about "Tower Heist," a ridiculous, fun and funny caper film that is very much an ensemble piece, with Ben Stiller, Casey Affleck, Matthew Broderick, Michael Pena, Gabourey Sidibe and Tea Leoni sharing in the comedic spoils. It's a ludicrous story somewhat grounded in the raw feelings about the state of the economy, in which workers at an exclusive New York apartment high-rise seek to steal back at least some of the money from a Bernie Madoff-like figure (Alan Alda) who swindled them.
Clinical trials of the study within cancer patients are expected to begin in about three years, where questions regarding the kind of effect the technique will have on a living human body can be fully examined, Guevara-Patino said.

The mortgage settlement, announced in February, was filed in court last week. It's expected to send nearly $1 billion in total to Maryland — the sixth-largest state payment out of $25 billion nationwide. Most is earmarked for loan modifications such as principal reduction and for refinancing borrowers who are underwater on their mortgages. Victims of "unfair servicing practices" who were foreclosed on between 2008 and last year also will receive payments of $1,800 to $2,000.

Learning new words adds gray matter, as a matter of fact. (Your brain doesn't have to shrink with age.) And adults actually are better at learning new languages than kids, if you can put aside linguistic habits (the brain gets trained to ignore sounds that it doesn't need for comprehension) and embrace the nonsensical. That's how kids learn; they associate sounds with objects, then recognize sounds and words as labels, then link words with meaning. So to learn a new language, whether it's with a class or through audio tapes, remember these tips:

"It's never that I don't want the ball to come to me. Once I reach that point, then I have some serious problems. I want the ball," Tulo said.

Didn't they learn anything from the Spitzer debacle? And don't they understand where this nation is and the desperate pain it is in?

As an anthropologist with personal ties to the problem of addiction, I have studied the social and historical influences of drug use, and that has made me skeptical about the idea of a vaccine. Entrenched poverty, social inequality and personal despair all promote drug use, and these things profoundly shape the unequal outcomes of the addicted. Where I lived and worked, illicit drugs were more available than mental health services, and heroin was often used as a "medicine" to relieve the suffering of everyday life.
At Stuttgart, we switched to an Intercity Express ( ICE) built by Siemens and operated by Deutsche Bahn, the German national railway.

C YOGI BERRA*: When I sketched out the 10-greatest list, I had Johnny Bench written in ink and was ready to move on to other positions. Berra's 10 World Series titles and 14 American League pennants drew back to his stats just to check. Obviously, that caused me to reconsider. Bench, rightfully, gets a lot of play as the game's best all-time catcher. He has eight Gold Gloves, he backstopped the mighty Red Machine, and he hit 389 home runs in his career. It's hard to pick against him at this position, except Berra's accomplishments are just as impressive. They seem to be hidden by his character, his quotes and his role with the Second Yankee Dynasty. Look for yourself:

Inexpensive. If you know where your travelers are heading next year, guidebooks and maps are no-brainers. Head for a good bookstore or log onto a few online book sites. If they're dedicated European train travelers, the summer edition of the Thomas Cook European Timetable is invaluable for itinerary planning, available from online bookstores. (Sadly, Cook no longer issues the companion worldwide edition.) Foodies would love a Zagat guide or full-year subscription to Zagat's online service (zagat.com).

Most of those are given to Concetta Tomei in the role of wealthy widow Valerie, who's funding the proposed memorial on the shores of the Sea of Galilee for the victims of a terrorist attack on an Israeli bus.

But the longer route and the lower price estimate, which surfaced in news reports over the weekend, are all part of a desperate effort for high-speed rail leaders to save a project that has skyrocketed in both costs -- and critics -- since voters first approved a bullet train four years ago.

øA: We're trying to communicate with elected officials because we do think there is a loophole in the current system. But it's not just Wal-Mart. The very small retailers, the locally owned retailers, are affected by this, those companies that create jobs locally across small towns and cities across America.

That's probably one of those loopholes that probably needs to be closed.

Conservative leaders and groups harvest those emotions to raise money and energize their supporters.

Ted Strickland. "Think about that. So companies have left Cleveland to go to Indiana. Companies have left Cleveland to go across the border to Michigan. And yet it’s easy in a campaign to fan the flames of protectionism" and to claim that the jobs went to "Mexico or Canada or, more likely, China."

"It wasn't anything personal" about Jay, Wornum says, "but I just didn't trust him." In hindsight, he says, "it was probably the wrong thing to do."
He said that he initially took the contribution because Georgia-Pacific is owned by Koch Industries. "As much as I support the timber industry in this state, I want to be clear that I don't support the Koch brothers' harmful anti-union agenda," said Schaufler in a statement. "And I've decied that the best way to take a stand against their anti-union actions is to send back their money."

It wasn't supposed to be this way. Parties seeking comebacks after devastating failures invariably follow a model with a strong track record: push the ideological envelope, lose, tack back to the middle, reap the rewards. For Republicans, this came after Barry Goldwater was routed in 1964. The party rebuilt slowly, regaining power under the relatively moderate Richard Nixon. For Democrats, it fueled the Clinton era.

There simply wasn't enough evidence things were headed in the right direction to warrant staying the course. Spagnuolo's defensive scheming was never in question. His game management came under fire at times, however, and the Rams struggled to win when games were close in fourth quarters. The 49ers' ability to fool the Rams with a fake field goal Sunday strengthened the impression that Spagnuolo could not make the difference in close games.
Benett's performance in goal was just as crucial, especially in the Spartans' CCS semifinal against defending champion St. Francis.

11:55 a.m. Rubin asks Marks about malingering. She says people who are faking will usually give themselves away. "It's really hard to fake mental illness," she says. She says there is no evidence that Neuman looked up psychiatric terms on the Internet. She noted that she didn't base her opinion solely on what Neuman told her, but other people's observations that "help support that the things he's reporting are genuine."
Paying attention to those who do the fighting -- and too often the dying -- in the nation's wars has been a hallmark of Gates' time at the Pentagon. Though brought in by President George W. Bush to redirect the attention of Washington's unwieldy political and defense establishment on the surge and new counterinsurgency strategy in Iraq, Gates never lost sight of those he was responsible for sending into harm's way.
No injuries have been reported. The cause of both fires is under investigation. It wasn't immediately known how much equipment was destroyed by either fire.

“Inspecting the six distinct layers of tissue that make up a woman's vaginal wall, Ostrzenski said, he uncovered small, grape-like clusters of erectile tissue housed in a sac less than 1 centimeter across -- ‘a deep, deep structure’ nestled between the vaginal wall's fifth layer, the endopelvic fascia, and its sixth, the dorsal perineal membrane.”
Vladimir, a Yugoslavian immigrant, makes his meager living doing balloon tricks at children's birthday parties but longs to win admiration as a great magician. He's working on the big illusion he hopes will make his name, but is distracted by the problem of his kleptomaniac wife's "shopping" trips.

Much work remains. Statewide, at least 32 patients died as a result of preventable errors in 2009, the latest data released by the Oregon Patient Safety Commission. In nine cases, a surgical team operated on the wrong body part or the wrong patient.

Even if you don't normally spend $11 for a cocktail, you'll want to just to experience the time-warp setting at Manifesto. Co-owner Ryan Maybee has worked hard to re-create the room's legitimately scandalous past, from its speakeasy days during Prohibition to an equally notorious stint as the dungeon of the Dixie Belle nightclub in the '80s and '90s.
Interestingly, autism is also more common in the north, perhaps because moms there don't get enough sunlight to load up on vitamin D, a compound that plays a big role in development. We live in Montana, so again, who knows? Perhaps our address played a role.

Like Marriner, Bell conducts from the concertmaster's chair — or in this case, piano bench — and thus appeared to return the ASMF to its roots. (Bell was soloist in the Violin Concerto, so he stood for that.) He got such astonishingly rich string sonorities that the winds, brass and timpani sounded almost as though they had been brought in as guest artists.

When you consider movies like the underrated "Raggedy Man" (1981), "The River" (1984) and "The Straight Story" (1999), you can imagine Spacek tapping the kinds of small-town experiences she shares in the pages of "My Extraordinary Ordinary Life."

Terry Hoskins of Moscow in southwest Ohio says he has struggled with the RiverHills Bank over his Clermont County home for years and had problems with the Internal Revenue Service. He says the IRS placed liens on his store and commercial property and the bank claimed his house as collateral.
Insomniacs occasionally hosts concerts for local bands, as well as open-mic nights. As I sat on the couch and sipped my beer, the jukebox was suddenly muted and a Rush song came on over the PA by the drum set.

"This has nothing to do with my life. It's totally a fantasy," says co-writer and director Wes Anderson of his film about two misfit 12-year-olds who, pledging eternal love, run away to a small, New England island. "But I remember the experience of being a fifth-grader, and how powerful the feeling of being in love was at that age, and how important a fantasy world is." The disillusioned grown-ups are played by Bill Murray, Frances McDormand, Ed Norton, Bruce Willis and Tilda Swinton, but their star power didn't earn them any cossetted treatment on location in Rhode Island. With no dressing rooms, they were asked to come to set "camera ready," which Anderson says helps move filming along. "When people are in the theater they take care of themselves," he points out. "I mean, sometimes someone doesn't want to walk through their hotel lobby in a police uniform but Bruce Willis" — who plays a cop — "wasn't staying in a hotel, so that wasn't a problem." (May 25)

Arpaio prefers to think that the unique nature of Martinez-Villaman's claim is a promising sign.
Then Adam arrives, and nothing goes as they expected. He cries for hours on end, and soon whatever they thought they had with each other is harder to find, with 18-month-old César Desseix as young Adam a born heartbreaker with old soul eyes (Gabriel plays Adam at 8). With this, the story settles into the grim rituals that come with any disease, the round of doctors before you know exactly what fate has dealt you, the way complaints about a crying baby are dismissed. It takes months before anyone really listens, and when the diagnosis comes, it is deadly. Time slows and life is lived in hospitals.
And when Kentucky finished its shootaround Thursday, Calipari observed Knight waiting for the clock in the gym to expire. Two seconds remained and Knight let off a shot. It doesn’t take Knight’s grades to realize what happened next.

Season recap: Empire's post-season quest almost ended before the midway point of the season, as the team got off to a 5-11 start and lost six in a row at one point. Nobody expected Empire to rebound. This was a school known more for its good grades and laptop-filled school than its baseball acumen. But the baseball team regrouped and won nine of its final 10 regular season games. But a disappointing showing in its region tournament left Empire with a No. 11 seed in the Class 3A tournament. Empire rebounded again, upsetting its first three tournament opponents on its way to the state championship game. Empire lost the final 8-2 to Chino Valley, but Empire became the first team from its school to reach a state championship game. Empire finished its season with a 17-15 record.

For nature buffs, hikers and bird watchers, Magnolia Springs makes a good base of operations for exploring the Bon Secour National Wildlife Refuge and the Weeks Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve, as well as the Alabama Coastal Birding Trail. Animal lovers will not want to miss the Alabama Gulf Coast Zoo and its "Animal Encounters" program that allows visitors to have direct inside-the-cage experiences with young kangaroos, lemurs and other animals. The zoo was featured in the Animal Planet series, "The Little Zoo That Could." It's a short drive north to the artsy town of Fairhope, east to the surprising shopping mecca that is Foley (lots of outlet stores), and south to the lively beach hangouts in Gulf Shores and Orange Beach. Or, you could simply stay off-the-radar in Magnolia Springs and be perfectly content to hide away in the trees by the river, with a walk to the corner store, or a fishing lure cast in the river, being the only concerns of the day.

Award of Excellence: Papa’s Tomato Pies, 804 Chambers St., Trenton; (609) 392-0359. The two De Lorenzos in Trenton get all the attention, but this wood-paneled pizzeria has the history.

Nick does a mustard pie (it’s weirdly compelling), but stick to the plain; it’s a doughy delight.

at Indiana 93, Orlando 78: David West had 18 points and 11 rebounds to help Indiana level the series at one game apiece. Danny Granger and George Hill each scored 18 points and Paul George had 17 points and eight rebounds for Indiana.

Pippin has a bizarre finale, beautifully done here, and I'm not about to give it away. I've always been stumped by what the last scene, with its powerful song, tries to tell us. It seems to say that you can't pursue your dreams and at the same time grasp reality. Bummer - and hardly in the spirit of the musical. My wife and I began to talk about the finale's meaning after the show, then realized we'd wondered about it decades ago. That ambiguity may be a flaw in Pippin - but its ability to force us once again into the same line of thought made us chuckle.

Des McAnuff, director of the "Superstar" revival, also shifts the focus from religion to politics in talking about his production, though he stands on firmer ground.

Boeheim and the university are also facing a defamation suit filed by the ballboys - Bobby Davis and stepbrother Mike Lang.

Just looking at that title of John C. Murphy's letter to the editor ("Catholics should know better than to oppose gay marriage," April 18) makes me laugh. As if the writer is some expert on what people should know. Maybe we can call it Murphy's Law — Catholics are not allowed to protest on anything. After all, the writer claims that Catholics were denied rights in Colonial Maryland, and after two more unrelated and arguable sentences, there is supposed to be some analogy to gay marriage.

Neither career diplomats at State nor their current Obama-ite political overseers ever much cottoned to the War on Terror — which made it so much more difficult to come to terms with our enemies. But the threat was the mother of the Department of Homeland Security, parent of the TSA, and remains the mother’s milk of its empire-building.
We know, from the casualty figures on TV, how dangerous this duty is. The film shows how confoundingly hard it is. Soldiers trained, in the narrator's words, to stop a Russian advance must now contend with a crazy-making range of circumstances. They stop traffic for 15 minutes until a suspicious-looking plastic bag can be examined. (The bag turns out to be empty). They function as truant officers, taking a glue-sniffing Iraqi kid off the street. They guide a rambling debate in an Iraqi district town meeting with unflagging patience. They burst into the house of suspected bomb-builders. (No bombs are found, but several residents are detained, then transferred to Abu Ghraib prison.) And, night after night, they go out on patrol in neighborhoods where, at any moment, they can be pinned down by sniper fire, or blown apart by improvised explosive devices.

The complaint about "Boardwalk Empire" having too many characters and too many narrative lines in the water is accurate and unfair. It's accurate because this show makes "The Sopranos" looks like "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" There are more characters than "The Great Race" or "It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World" or one of those movies with so many featured performances their head shots were lined up at the bottom of the poster. It's unfair because most of the characters on "Boardwalk Empire" are fascinating people, historical and fictional, who more than justify their time onscreen. The only problem is finding time for all of them. Chalky White (played by the great Michael K. Williams)? Richard Harrow (Jack Huston)? Arnold Rothstein (Michael Stuhlbarg)? Esther Randolph (Julianne Nicholson)? Bring them on!
That was a big bone of contention with former Browns President John Collins. In fact, Collins used Savage's skimpy office hours as a major point in his argument to fire Savage after the 2005 season.

The plan is patently unconstitutional because Congress cannot delegate its' core responsibilities to the president. For example, Congress cannot give the president its authority to declare war. The Supreme Court held the legislation granting a line item veto unconstitutional because Congress could not authorize the president to eliminate individual appropriated items, appropriations a core Congressional power. Thus, the president could not today be empowered to unilaterally say what appropriated programs would be stricken. Congress has historically been indifferent to the constitutionality of legislation, leaving it to the courts to decide years later after the crises have passed.

There are two main approaches so far. The first takes advantage of "pasteboards" in Apple's mobile operating system. These were designed to allow users to copy and paste data from one application to another, but developers discovered they can also employ them to store a unique ID that persists even if an app is closed or the system reboots.

Multispectral digital imaging is crucial. At a pivotal moment, it dramatically redirects the search for answers to Poland. But crucial too are countless human skills: An ability, for instance, to tell from brushstrokes that the painter was left-handed (like Leonardo), and the historical depth and breadth to speculate that the young woman may have belonged to Milan's ruling family, the Sforzas, a major patron of Leonardo.

As county attorney in 1994 and 1995, he set in place a legacy of following the letter of the law — a process about which Lake had never been overly particular before his arrival. But the slow-growth majority was short-lived, and Lake went on to grow rapidly in the far-flung areas Reed passionately believed should remain off limits to development to maintain the county's rural lifestyle.

First, the fortified rules are readable and understandable. They boil down and incorporate all default Ohio ethics statutes, so that a seeker after rules needs look in only one place. The proposal adds to that law new and unequivocal county prohibitions: 1) against nepotism and patronage; 2) against conflicting secondary employment; 3) against conflicting interests in board appointments; 4) against political contributions to elected employers; and 5) against improprieties in the filing of ethics complaints.

Several nice picnic areas lie just off the trail, among lovely glades of pine and oak, Douglas fir and Arizona cypress. The canyon floor is littered with gray boulders covered with ancient moss and lichen, giving the hike an altogether different feel from many Sedona-area hikes, with their open expanses of bare rock.
Currently, executive office members have to report income and stock holdings in ranges, the highest of which is more than $500,000. State lawmakers’ reports are less detailed, with the highest range of income at just $50,000. Christie said he wanted the highest range to be $50 million.

Just as the poor schlump's trying to decide which nipple he's least unwilling to part with, his torturer's cell phone rings. It's Dad, back home in rustic Inishmore. Seems the torturer's cat, Wee Thomas, is doing poorly. (In actuality, though Dad's too chicken to come out and say it, the beast looks plenty dead, its brains smushed out in the middle of a road).Padraic, the torturer, turns pale. Wee Thomas, as it happens, is his best and only friend. No surprise there, since Padraic, the sadistic centerpiece of Martin McDonagh's black comedy "The Lieutenant of Inishmore," is a nasty piece of business. In fact, pretty much everyone in "Inishmore" is a nasty piece of business, although Padraic does take the cake.

Spread the onions over the bottom of a 9- by 13-inch baking dish. Sprinkle half the bread crumbs over the onions, then sprinkle on half the cheese. Use the back of a spoon to make eight nests in the mixture. Crack an egg into each indentation. Top with a sprinkle of salt and pepper and the remaining bread crumbs and cheese. Bake 15 to 20 minutes or until the cheese is melted and the egg whites opaque. The eggs should be a little more jiggly than you want them because they'll continue cooking after you take them out of the oven. Serve with toast.

A lot of this looks interesting (the village and the woods, for example, are a riot of spikes, triangles and sharp points), and that’s probably Hardwicke’s chief concern. She worked for years as a production designer, and her own movies always have a strong visual sense.
A constitutional amendment making it easier to float even more debt to finance projects of dubious public worth is the last thing this fiscal basket case of a state needs right now.
Even in a state with nearly $40 billion in debt, it’s uncertain whether money is enough of a reason for the legislature to override the governor’s veto.
I had no good answer. The journey is made by ship, and I get seasick. Except for all those inhabitants milling about in tuxedos, there are none of the cultural features of other destinations: no cuisine, architecture, folk art, lush history or tongue-twisting language. For its lack of humidity, meteorologists refer to Antarctica as "the world's driest desert"; and for those seeking the diversions of traditional travel, it is a desert indeed.
That does not mean that scientists will be able to control it.

True. But we would never ask NBA guys to play five games in five days. And the Huskies just might be a fluke. It’s possible they’re benefitting from the weirdest aspect of the March season, when a single intangible becomes a predominant factor in these games: the factor of unfamiliarity. One bad matchup on a random day, and the better team can lose — get crushed, in fact.
The program would set limits on new or increased water withdrawals by businesses or other entities in the Lake Erie basin. If the limits are exceeded, a state permit would be required.
Hip-Hop was a rabbit of some kind who sported a bandana and sunglasses and apparently gave the team an edginess -- if that's possible for a rabbit -- that fit in with the Allen Iverson era. The Philadelphia Daily News' Rich Hoffman portrayed the team's announcement this way:
Last week, more than 140 health groups called on the U.N. to set guidelines to manage potential conflicts of interest in their dealings with the food and beverage industry. “Without such safeguards, policies and recommendations will invariably be weakened to suit the interests of powerful corporations,” the coalition said in a letter to the medical journal, Lancet.
The problem is it didn't take long for the right to put a "but..." at the end of that support. For example Sarah Palin still accuses Obama of "pussy-footing" by not releasing photos of a dead Osama bin Laden. Also they add that Obama wanted to shut down Gitmo and according to them jeopardizing the mission to get Osama. How quick they were to use this to further their ideological narrative.
"Everyone likes to have villains," said Kansas City lawyer Gene Graham, whose firm handles medical malpractice cases. "They want to find someone to blame. Trial lawyers have become convenient targets for people who want to say they're responsible."
Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, Turkey's founder, rejected the legacy of the Ottomans and their Islamic precepts, deeming them backward and imposing a secular, Western-oriented outlook that remains the subject of national debate today. In Shah, though, he may have seen a link to Turkic origins in Central Asia, a source of veneration in his new order.
Outlook: FAU once again plays a tough nonconference schedule. It will likely take more than just one season for Pelini and his staff install their game plan and start earning more wins.
You must be audacious when there's no time to waste. Emanuel pledges to remake Chicago in a mere three years. Just around the time his mayoral term ends - and the 2016 presidential campaign begins.

"As a person of faith, my God believes you shouldn't take advantage of people when they are down," said Dawn Dannenbring of the community group Illinois People's Action, addressing CEO Jamie Dimon. "Do you believe in the same God I believe in?"
The government in March rejected Chrysler's restructuring plan and gave it 30 days to make another effort, including a tie-up with Fiat. The company, which has borrowed $4 billion from the federal government and needs billions more, faces deadline tonight to cut labor costs, slash debt and take on a partner if it wants more aid. President Barack Obama said Wednesday night while the lender talks were still ongoing that he was "very hopeful" that deals can be worked out to keep Chrysler LLC a viable automaker, and more hopeful than he was a month ago that the company will stay in business.
Call me bourgeois, but I had the best time at Eventi, a middle-of-the-road addition to the scene from Kimpton. The boutique hotel chain, founded in 1981 in San Francisco, knows all the little touches to make guests happy, without driving the room rate into the stratosphere.

In an interview prior to the show, latter-day GN'R bassist Tommy Stinson insisted that he couldn't care less about the Rock Hall or about excluding current members from the induction.
Allegations that the Georgia businessman sexually harassed subordinates as head of the National Restaurant Association in the late 1990s have been catnip to political reporters, blending issues of power, sex, race and money and pitting Cain's word against that of at least four accusers. The story has led news broadcasts, made headlines in major papers and driven reporters to track the candidate's every move.
Regions is seeking a buyer for Morgan Keegan, based in Memphis, Tenn., to improve capital and eventually repay a $3.5 billion U.S. bailout, the largest still outstanding for any institution under the Treasury's bank rescue program.
We rode the ferry from Old Town and walked through the moss- and mushroom-laden forest to reach the sand dunes and pristine beaches of Smiltyne. We picked wildflowers, swam in the calm sea, and listened to the chirping gulls and lapping waves.

BIGGEST SURPRISE
Don't get me wrong, I love Portland. There's a lightness to the place, a newness and novelty that is exciting and vital. Things start here. There's a quirkiness that is almost charming in its self-awareness. A sense of community that is rare in cities its size. And a friendly competitiveness that screams, "come on in, the water's fine!"

Slightly more sophisticated readers will notice how cleverly the fox sows dissatisfaction with his seemingly innocent remarks.… Readers who have experience with how difficult even the best relationships can be will admire how Mini Grey hits this tricky nail on the head. Her illustrations contain as much subtlety as her text. Uncannily like marriage (how else do you parse the division of household chores among Dog, Cat and Mouse?), the arrangement contains the seeds of its own misery ("They lived happily. Or so they thought…") but needs a precipitating factor from the outside to lose its balance. A brilliant detail is that the traveling Fox is a salesman for the Winds of Change Trading Company. What has drawn him there? Why does he tap so easily into everyone's dissatisfaction? What catastrophe will bring the three to their senses? And when peace is restored, all readers will notice that, while Fox is gone, the Winds of Change have left their mark.

Kym Lukosky is not one to let herself feel paralyzed. "It's much better to think about what could happen and be prepared," says the mother of three in Seattle. She's been prepared for a flu pandemic ever since the avian flu scare of 2006, with latex gloves and top-quality respirator masks stored at home, and enough food -- rice, beans, pasta and the like -- for a month.
I absolutely refuse to believe that the anti-immigrant crowd makes any distinction between legal and illegal immigrants. How can they tell the difference? Employers certainly make no such distinctions, because otherwise it's hard to see why they wouldn't certify all their fruit and vegetables as picked by U.S. citizens, if only in the interest in their bottom lines.
At Mompou, which is usually closed at lunchtime on a Saturday, owner Steve Yglesias opened the doors in hopes of a fan turnout. But just a few tables were filled around 2 p.m., and not many people had come in earlier, Yglesias said.

She collided head-on with a Ford Escort driven by Darnell Warner, 23, of Hazelwood. After being hit, Warner's car rotated into the path of a tractor-trailer, which was also going east on the highway. The tractor-trailer hit the passenger side of Warner's car, then the truck ran off the highway and hit a sign.
The poet William Stafford got up every morning at 5, sat on his couch with a pen and pad and just looked out the window. Poetry came up when it could.
The widening gulf between the haves and have-nots, the 1 percent and the 99 percent, over the past three decades is not merely some partisan invention of President Obama, the Democrats or the Occupy Wall Street protesters but a real and worrisome trend fueled largely by the financial sector. Income inequality inevitably gives rise to economic instability — which is essentially what's happening in the European Union, where income differences are even more out of whack.
Another perfect pair are the feisty, sassy, witty friends Ouiser (Jaszmyn Epps) and Clairee (Jena Doering). Doering's posture and diction are crystal clear, and she never misses a beat, or a chance for a joke. Her quirky banter with Epps lightens the atmosphere and carries the show.

While treating Shakur for the head trauma, doctors at Children's Hospital found out about the previous fracture on his right upper arm. It was spiral in shape - typically a red flag for abuse in infants and toddlers.
2008, United States, 95 minutes. This is an old-fashioned, straight-ahead documentary about the 34th annual Miss Gay America Pageant. Directors Ron Davis and Stewart Halpern profile five of the contestants. Some are pageant veterans, others are looking for that big break. Getting ready for the pageant isn't a sashay in the park, but a full-scale, sequined assault. The costumes look as if they were designed by the cake creators on the Food Network. And while it's all great fun for the audience, it's serious business to the drag queens strutting the stage.
The purpose of the Hancock Amendment is “to protect taxpayers, not political subdivisions,” the attorney general argued in post-trial briefs. The purpose of the transfer law “is to protect individual students.” As long as allowing transfers would be harmless to taxpayers, “the Hancock Amendment cannot be a shield against those transfers.”
"We expected these results," said Dan Romportl, executive director of the Committee to Elect a Republican Senate. "The protest candidates were recruited as placeholders and we didn't put any resources behind them. ... This is more of a formality and we can move on to the final stretch."

When casting for the dark poet/writer Edgar Allen Poe, I’m guessing Johnny Depp or Robert Downey, Jr. would’ve been the studios first choice. Although, Downey might not have worked in this, since the movie really tried to be like the recent Sherlock Holmes films.

The ad also implies the bakery faces a 40 percent increase in taxes. Revenue raised by corporate income taxes will indeed rise that much. But most Oregon businesses pay personal income taxes; they would not face an increase anywhere near that magnitude. While the ad dismisses the idea that businesses “only pay $10 in taxes,” most companies subject to the corporate tax do indeed pay just a $10 minimum tax now. Many do pay other kinds of taxes, such as local property taxes.

I was lucky enough to get my hands on a copy of Thomas' 1862 book, "How to Mix Drinks or the Bon-Vivant's Companion," back in the early '90s. It set me back $125, and considering that copies of the 1928 edition of this landmark publication now fetch as much as $450 on eBay, I think my money was well spent. If I sell the thing I might even be able to keep paying Wondrich's bar tab for another few years.

If you argue honestly, as St. Thomas always did, you will find that the subject sometimes seems as if it would never end...Being himself resolved to argue, to argue honestly, to answer everybody, to deal with everything, he produced books enough to sink a ship or stock a library; though he died in comparatively early middle age. Probably he could not have done it at all, if he had not been thinking even when he was not writing; but above all thinking combatively. This, in his case, certainly did not mean bitterly or spitefully or uncharitably; but it did mean combatively. As a matter of fact, it is generally the man who is not ready to argue who is ready to sneer. That is why, in recent literature, there has been so little arguement and so much sneering.

"I'm going back into the pub business," Kieran Folliard told me earlier this week. He was joking, of course. Sort of. The owner of 2 Gingers Irish Whiskey (and former pub maestro) is partnering with Target Field on a rebranding of its Twins Pubs. They'll now be called the 2 Gingers Pubs. The small bars sit side-by-side behind home plate at the ballpark (one houses the organ player). Folliard said he's in a mad scramble to get them redecorated in time for the Twins' home opener on Monday. However, they won't necessarily have an Irish pub look. It'll be more of an "old-fashioned, summertime, front-porch feeling," he said. I imagine Folliard's signature cocktail, the refreshing Big Ginger, will go over nicely at the mini-pubs. In fact, 2 Gingers will be available in all of Target Field's bars. Craft beers from Surly and Fulton are also new at the ballpark this year.

Kristie and Jessica: That all insects and spiders are out to get you. it's really not true. These animals don't care about you. They want to eat, mate and make it through the day. (Not so different from us, really…) For the most part, bites and stings are in self-defense. There are exceptions, like female mosquitoes and other arthropods that need the protein in blood in order to reproduce, but on the whole they mind their own business. Humans tend to think it's all about us, but it's not. Believe us, if insects and spiders were really out to get us, there would be no escape. They would win, hands down.

Francois Hollande, the moderate Socialist with a clear lead in opinion polls, condemned Sarkozy's tactics as unworthy of French politics and a sign of desperation from a president who fears he is headed for defeat after only one term. But he also expressed understanding of the 18 percent of first-round voters who backed the National Front candidate, Marine Le Pen, and he emphasized a need to respond to their complaints that conventional politics has passed them by.

The Sun has published editorials, usually several a day, throughout almost its entire 175-year history.

Mr. Biden's talent for connecting with audiences of various backgrounds does not come, to be sure, without a price on many occasions.

At Manino, Colton acts like a supreme assh--- (sorry for the language) and won’t even talk to Bill. Bill calls him a stuck-up brat. Colton then puts his own spin on things, and makes Bill out to be the villain. He then brings up offering to go to Tribal Council instead of the women. I think that boy’s cheese done slid off his cracker. The other men all think so too, but they also know that Colton has the personal Immunity Idol, and he’s running things a little bit. I can’t believe they are even considering this, and neither can the women.

But it's hard to know how GM and Chrysler would be alive today if the then-President George Bush had followed Romney's advice not to authorize any direct federal aid to the automakers, or if Bush's successor had been reluctant to provide debtor-in-possession financing for the quick-rinse bankruptcy that ensued.

My husband got Legionella pneumonia and was transported to a Seattle hospital. This was the beginning of a 10-day stay. The ship's doctor filed all the information and I was soon contacted for trip arrangements home as soon as he was able to travel. We were in almost daily contact to figure out when we'd be able to fly. My husband's oxygen level was not up to par, so we were escorted home by a flight nurse who (arranged) private transportation to the airport. The cruise line made flight reservations for my husband and the flight nurse, but I was to make my own and then be reimbursed by the trip insurance. In all our travels, this was the first time we've made a claim on trip insurance. The flight nurse said she has rescued people from every part of the world, of every age, and believes all travelers, domestic or foreign, should buy annual trip insurance just in case."

So if Rice and the Ravens can’t reach an agreement on a long-term deal by July 16, we’re probably going to be talking about the same thing at this time next year.

But Luck and Manning share too many characteristics to ignore. Both are crazy smart; you don't graduate on time from Stanford with a high GPA in architectural engineering by being a dope.

Both finished second in the Heisman voting.

On the benefits of exercise and menopause: "A reason to keep active is just the endorphins that help you reduce stress. ... I try and do something every day. I understand that's something that's going to be with me for the rest of my life. I have to do that for my body. I'm on the extreme end of what most of your readers are going to get out of this, but I've been at it for so long, and that's why I do what I do. What I see in the general population is that women who are my age that don't exercise, that don't lift weights, that don't walk -- I call them matronly. They tend to look matronly, kind of rounder in the center; they just look like (they have) no shape. I've paid attention to it when I was in my 40s, and maybe that was a little bit of a driving force. I don't do weights, because I just don't, but I do plyometrics, and that's something you can do in your backyard. I go in my back yard and jump and hop; I do lunges. I do that to keep a strong muscle mass because I know that just running isn't going to do that."

The room remains an artful modern-retro mash-up, with green-and-white rolling leather chairs in a library trimmed with modern walnut. And this was a menu with real cooking that proved the genre didn't have to be just broiler jocks and football-sized spuds. Sure, the $100 cheesesteak is a gimmick, and the wine markups are egregious.

For decades, producers made their money on the front half of the bird but lost money on the back half, said Bill Roenigk, senior vice president and economist with the National Chicken Council. That began changing in the 1990s as the industry found new markets in Russia, Asia and Latin America. While producers still lose money on dark meat, he said, the difference isn't as great as it once was.

Some might find this kind of Chinese carpetbagging worrisome. But a smart president would see that exporting gas to China while helping Beijing open its vast shale reserves would not only boost our own economy, but help smooth the way for Beijing to build its energy future on cooperation with the democracies of the West, rather than Iran, Syria and other dictatorships of the East.
Many believe the austerity program is necessary to keep bond investors from panicking about the possibility that more European nations will default or require bailouts. But a growing number, like Hollande, say the cuts have been too much, too fast. They say the region's economy can't return to growth unless governments stop tightening the fiscal noose and start spending again to create demand.
"Five minutes from the end, the title seemed out of reach," Milan manager Massimiliano Allegri said. "Then Lecce scored and in the final minutes it seemed like we were at theater awaiting the end of an opera. ... Now we're going to be motivated for the derby.

Buckwheat fettuccine with fontina from Val d'Aosta and oyster mushrooms, though, is too bland. And I'd have to say that pizza is not the kitchen's strong suit either. They're fine, just not that compelling. Maybe it's the crust, which doesn't have much flavor, considering it's baked in a wood-burning oven. Toppings are oddball too. Smoked mozzarella would have been better on its own than paired with a tomato sauce, for example.

There are days here, in these war-haunted times, when it seems that death might come in any guise, and from any direction. From a bomb buried in the earth. From the sky. From a rusted motorbike haphazardly parked in a busy marketplace, with no one paying it and its deadly package any notice.

The politicians who would give us $2.50 a gallon oil for a short time would be retired and prospering with their huge pensions, their big bribes from their lobbyist friends and the other multi-million dollar retirement packages that all politicians seem to acquire.

The museum has scheduled 60 musical, puppetry and dance performances over the next several months to bring alive the cultural context many of these objects were designed for. "What's really fun is that the exhibit has such a wide range of media," Reichle says. "It's a really rich environment in the galleries, trying to show the breadth of the culture and how these objects connect to one another."
Between the two of them, I think Rutgers has a very good outlook for next year. Throwing a wrench into that and bringing another person into a position you really don't need another person in that role. This team is all aboard with Dodd, Nova, and the others and many of the young guys on the team only know the Savage that left them without a fight.
Yankees pitcher Ivan Nova dodged a lot of bullets during the 20 games he pitched between defeats.

Her decision not to follow the more soulful inflections of singers like Franklin drew criticism by some who saw her as playing down her black roots to go pop and reach white audiences.

Perhaps it was growing up in a Midcentury Modern home in Gilbert that made Bradley appreciate design. He said his parents' Robert Frankeberger home, designed by an associate of noted Midcentury architect Ralph Haver, was a great design but always a work in progress because his father had undertaken the building himself. He said completing this one was, in part, a tribute to his mother, who passed away in 2001.

As a result, Sunset Hills is moving the meeting to the community center to accommodate a large crowd.
The final critique is that the extension of unemployment insurance benefits is part of a set of stimulus programs that "have not worked." Of course, when a treatment is applied and the patient is not cured, we may have either the medicine wrong or the dose. In fact, the administration's stimulus programs created 3.3 million jobs, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The CBO has also found that because unemployment insurance puts money in the hands of those most likely to spend it; for each dollar put into the extensions, economic activity increases by $1.90. The medicine was effective, it just was not strong enough — and stopping the treatment altogether, when the unemployment rate is still 8.6 percent, makes little sense.
The Wings' captain, Lidstrom, has 20 years experience of going into the playoffs. "It's been harder and harder," he said. "You look at the teams that miss the playoffs, they're so close. It's hard to predict who's going to be a big favorite over another team."

Chase M. Ritenauer, 26, North Olmsted public works director, wants to make the streets safer and bring more jobs to a city that's been spiraling downward. It's a compelling pitch that helped him beat first-term Mayor Anthony Krasienko in the May Democratic primary. Actually accomplishing those goals will be harder, but Ritenauer is optimistic and full of ideas on the campaign trail, where he faces token opposition from Republican Timothy L. Baxter, 55. Ritenauer will need both optimism and ideas at City Hall.
If there are local message boards for new moms in your area, chances are they'll feature "nanny available" listings. These are usually posted by moms who are trying to find a new position for a nanny they no longer need. These boards are also an ideal place to put up a "nanny wanted" post. If you live in a small community, the recommendations for nannies that you receive might even come from an acquaintance or a friend of a friend.

Penn shows us Henry's furious maneuvering to ensure that the next generation of Tudors wouldn't have his legitimacy problems. The deaths of his oldest son, Arthur, in 1502 and of Elizabeth in 1503 were a staggering blow in so many ways. When Henry VII pulls out of public view after these deaths, though, Penn's characterization makes the reader suspect that Henry mourned the ruin of his royal plans as much as any personal losses that he felt.

Dinner is almost entirely Provencal. My favorite starter is one of several assiettes, platters of vegetables, cold meats and/or cheese ($9.50 vegetarian, $9.95 meat/cheese). The charcuterie (several kinds of ham, saucisson sec, cornichons, etc.) bursts with flavor; cheeses are across-the-board delicious. The price may seem a tad steep for an appetizer, but it's reasonable when you consider that this, like virtually all starters, happily feeds two people, unless they have huge appetites.

A: I can't make a recommendation now, since none of these tablets is out. However, I can make a few observations. Even on the current iPad, you can annotate files and take written notes in various apps. But the iPad isn't designed at heart for freehand note-taking and annotation, and you'd have to buy an add-on stylus. Some Android devices—even without Ice Cream Sandwich—have integrated note-taking and the stylus as a core feature. The latest is the Samsung Galaxy Note, a ginormous phone that is really a small tablet. As for Windows 8, it is designed to run the full version of Office. And the preview device Microsoft has supports handwriting and has a stylus in the box.

If only the track weren't so far from Cleveland. Then again, with the nearest indoor BMX park in Dayton, Canton isn't so bad.

Davies is a theoretical physicist who has taken up astrobiology (which I wish were still called "exobiology," since life is unlikely to exist on stars), but he's not much of an arm-waver: "We still don't know whether the origin of life on Earth was a freak event and whether the evolution of human intelligence was a statistical fluke.... The universe might be teeming with life, or it might turn out that life is very rare — intelligent life more so."

The birth of Snow’s hydrocephalitic daughter Valerie is often cited as the reason for the singer’s partial withdrawal from the spotlight. Snow refused to institutionalize Valerie, who died in 2007 at the age of 31, instead opting to care for her at home. But there is reason to believe that Snow was never entirely comfortable with the glamour and flash of the music business.

* Or to put it another way: the enigmatic Chris Stewart, who (justifiably) has been criticized by media and fans for his inconsistent and indifferent ways, has played fewer minutes than any Blues' forward in this series.

A testosterone gel for menopausal women makes sense medically, says Dr. Richard Paulson, professor of reproductive medicine and chief of reproductive endocrinology at USC's Keck School of Medicine.
"Moses Malone was one of the funniest. We were in Denver, I think he was playing with Philly at the time, and that day, a reporter had done a top-10 referee list and my name was in there. So my first call of the night is like a loose-ball foul on Moses, and Moses just turns and says, 'That is not a top-10 call.' I had to laugh."
“The thing you have to remember is, Michael faced a lot of doubters — no one gave him a chance, everyone wrote off hockey in South Florida,” Brett Yormark said. “And he worked tirelessly to make that team flourish in a very tough market. He accomplished something pretty amazing in our business.”
In our county budget, every other budgetary line item expires at the end of a fiscal year. This gives the freeholder board flexibility in funding the trust so that in lean years, much like 2011, the board could rationally determine not to make a contribution.

The newspaper’s review shows the governor was far more optimistic than his counterparts in New York, Pennsylvania and Delaware, which have lower unemployment rates than New Jersey but are forecasting revenue growth under 4.7 percent for next year.

Eventually, the conversation veered toward other topics, and I asked McMillan if, with the Blazers about to start their second back-to-back-to-back of the season, he had considered anything outside the box. Would he ever consider do something crazy like playing his reserves for the entire second half?
The potential transfer of thousands of students from the failing city school district to better ones in the county would drain St. Louis Public Schools financially, according to one analysis released this week.

"We are all placing our lives in God’s hands and placing our life in the service of others, to answer when that bell rings, to get in to the truck and go, knowing that it can require the sacrifice of one’s own life," Msgr. Andrew Szaroleta said during the funeral at Our Lady of Peace Church in the Fords section of Woodbridge.
This is also according to advice I've given others: We're flawed, all of us, and hoping to find an ideal person is not only pointless, it's also dehumanizing to people to expect them to meet your ideals. All you can realistically hope for are people who are self-aware enough and responsible enough to try to keep their frailties in check.
Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney said in recent days that all of the candidates wished the outside organizations would disappear and that their outsized sway was "a very bad idea."
Political comparisons are apt, as the basis of Anonymous, written by John Orloff, is that de Vere aimed to use his dramas to rouse the rabble and raise his illegitimate son to be Queen Elizabeth's successor. Like many Shakespeare plays, the pretext of Anonymous is royal succession. Who shall succeed Queen Elizabeth (Vanessa Redgrave)? Will it be James of Scotland, son of Elizabeth's cousin and political rival Mary, Queen of Scots, or the Earl of Southampton, Oxford's illegitimate son?

Campbell, 25, was shot in an apartment parking lot in North Portland. Police had been called to the scene on a report of a suicidal man who was armed. Campbell came out of the apartment with his hands behind his head, walking backward toward police, witnesses said. Police, who said he ignored commands to put his hands up, hit him with six beanbag rounds. Frashour then hit him in the back, firing the fatal shot with his AR-15 rifle. The officer said he saw Campbell reaching with both hands toward the back waistband of his pants and thought he might be reaching for a gun.
"I was waiting 10 minutes in the concession line and missed his home run," he says. There had to be some way to speed up the process and avoid waiting in a queue, he thought, by using a cellphone to order in advance. Two years later, he started Gopago, now a free download on iPhone, Android and BlackBerry devices. Recently, after an investment by JPMorgan Chase, Rocco says, things took off.

He knew no one, either his age or any age, who acknowledged being gay. Why would someone do so? So his secret stayed secret, and he was full of shame.

Jason Lucarelli: Lucarelli runs 1-888-Ohio Comp, a workers' compensation management company. Kelley and another trial witness, Joe Gallucci, said they met with Lucarelli and his father, Sam, to discuss having the company pay Gallucci. Gallucci, who ran a sham campaign against Frank Russo, said he got five $2,000 checks from 1-888-Ohio Comp though he did no work for the company. Attorney Albert Giulani has repeatedly said the Lucarellis have done nothing wrong. He could not be reached Friday.
Nettheim is weaker on suspense. The mystery goes slack as the film trudges on. Martin rents space in a rural home for his base camp, and his involvement with the owner (Frances O'Connor) and her inquisitive kids (Morgana Davies and Finn Woodlock) begins to take precedence over his quest. Even Dafoe can't make us believe that a cold-blooded mercenary would change his spots so quickly.
The Tonto Trail leads first through Monument Creek, named for an immense pillar of sandstone rising a hundred feet or more from the creek bed. The tree-lined creek is a popular camping area.

From tasteless photos to urinating on dead insurgents, bad behavior by U.S. troops in Afghanistan is hampering America's war effort in Afghanistan, triggering a broad new campaign by defense leaders to improve discipline in the ranks.
There are economists who insist that companies must focus only on the cold, hard bottom line—and that capitalism itself depends in part on this unwavering focus. Back in 1970, Milton Friedman wrote a legendary essay for the "New York Times Magazine" titled "The Social Responsibility of Business Is to Increase Its Profits." Friedman pooh-poohed companies' charitable efforts, arguing that it's the sole duty of a business executive to maximize profits for shareholders. If executives wish to do good, they are free to plow their salaries into charitable works. The company itself has no special competence in good-deed doing and should stay well clear of the game.
Dennis Dennehy, a spokesperson for the rapper, said: ''He's focusing on his music right now, so while he's doing that, while he's in that space, he wanted to put this on hold for the time being.''
"I think (Columbia) Coach (Mark) Sandstrom had a great gameplan and knew what we were going to do, I think we had a pretty good idea what they were going to do. When teams are struggling to shoot and the other team is playing good defense I think you are going to see what you saw tonight."

An African-American candidate would also likely get into the race, perhaps one of Wessel's colleagues on the Board of Aldermen.
Epicactus always needs to dry a bit between waterings, though it needs more water in spring and summer while it is actively growing than in winter, when it isn't. Mine is outside, under the house overhang, so I can provide winter water only when the potting mix is rather dry. The overhang protects it somewhat from cold, but if frost is predicted, I bring it inside. In summer it gets half-day sun. This is OK since my location is rather foggy, but a couple of hours of sun is enough in brighter locations. Indoors, an orchid cactus wants bright light out of direct sun.
"We're happy for any support from Columbus," he said. "This is really a statewide issue."
Police withheld the man's identity until they could inform relatives of his death.
There’s probably some sort of stylus under the screen that “etches” the drawing, but I always liked to think that magic happened when you turned the toy’s knobs.

In Porto, I remember eating sardines grilled outside a little restaurant near the sea accompanied by gulps of chilled vinho verde. It's easier to find the wine here now, and this bottling is well worth seeking out. Look for the characteristic tall slope-shouldered shape and the distinctive Trajarinho label.

"They know each other's game, they've been playing with each other for three, four years," Thomas said in the quiet Maryland dressing room. "You can see the kind of chemistry they have. They're a great team. You can't take that one away from them, but we'll be back."

To emphatically state otherwise,
It is also hard to exercise coercive authority over our secular leaders -- the president during his term in office or life-tenured Supreme Court justices. Political leaders may want our love (or at least our votes), but it may be that, unlike God, they are content to settle for our sullen, enforced obedience.

So either the Devils are lying or they have an odd feel for the human anatomy. Whatever. Kovalchuk’s absence meant Clarkson found himself on the team’s top line with Parise and Elias.
Westgate Fountain Park Market:
That would be the San Diego Chargers. Sure, they have beaten up on the Jaguars and the fading Bills the past two weeks, but they aren’t dead yet in the AFC West — that is, if you still don’t believe the Denver Broncos will win the rest of their games. Philip Rivers (46-of-61, 534 yards, six touchdowns and no picks the past two weeks) is playing like his old self. We’ll reserve judgment one more week on the Chargers’ awakening — until we see how Rivers fares against Terrell Suggs (three sacks, two forced fumbles today) and the Baltimore Ravens.

"These letters are like poison," she said.
If the three-night voyage I took with my wife, Ann, was any indication, passengers don't spend much time during the day looking out the picture windows in their cabins. On the first day, we were in the 10-seat skiffs by 9:30 a.m. (which I learned later was considered "sleeping in"), and by 10 a.m. we already had spotted a few dozen of the more than 400 species of birds in this region.

The original: Big idea gets its start: Led by local politicians Rod Diridon and Quentin Kopp, the California High-Speed Rail Authority proposed building a $33 billion railroad to whiz you from San Francisco to Los Angeles for $55. In 2008, voters narrowly passed a bond measure to fund one-third of the rail line, while envisioning private investors and the federal government would take care of the rest. The bountiful profits expected from 55 million annual riders would bankroll extensions to Sacramento and San Diego. Statewide, the plan was mostly ignored during an election dominated by Obama and Proposition 8.

The window of the shop held a small yellow bowl of assorted hard candy and a Coca-Cola placard featuring a beguiling blonde beauty with a tooth-powered smile.
Hollywood has been outspoken in its support of gay rights. Although Obama will be in a liberal bastion, California itself illustrates the crosscurrents of gay marriage.

Two commissioners were absent. The decision to reject the location was the biggest blow to the dog park plans since the project was proposed 10 years ago. City Councilmember Nancy Nadel (Downtown-West Oakland) had already committed $10,000 from District 3 discretionary funds. Pat Kernighan's Grand Lake-Chinatown district borders the area; she has promised $2,000. At-large Councilmember Rebecca Kaplan pledged another $2,000. The rest of the $35,000 budget would have come from the Public Works capital reserve fund.
Previously, owner Gil Ran and sommelier Ryan Hess had a short run with Vinoteque in Culver City before relocating to this address in a building below a music school.

There's nothing wrong with using a jigger, and some of today's best bartenders do exactly that, though other equally accomplished mixologists use the free-pouring method. Here's how it's done: Fit a bottle full of water with any brand of pour spout - different styles pour at different speeds. Pour into the 1-ounce side of a jigger, counting in your head, until you have poured an ounce. Repeat. Repeat again. Soon you will know what number to count to in order to pour an ounce, and once you know your number you'll be able to accurately pour without a jigger for the rest of your life. Providing you use the same brand of pourer, that is.
Demonstrators turned out in large numbers for May Day rallies in hard-hit European countries on Tuesday, protesting their governments' push for austerity and flexing populist muscle ahead of key Greek and French elections.
* In 1974 there were 1,089 complete games thrown in MLB. By 2000 that total had dropped to 234. Last season, there were only 173 complete games. So far this season, in 244 contests there have been nine complete games. Pitchers aren't mentally trained to go nine innings, because they know that once the 7th inning comes around, the manager is ready to reach for the phone to activate the bullpen.

If the lawyers defending Saints' linebacker Jonathan Vilma and the three other players suspended by the NFL try to claim there's no proof they supported the scheme, they're going to lose. Here's why: Money for the bounties mostly came from the players. How can you claim innocence for a crime you financed?
Which leads to the most intriguing idea so far from Cordell, though it's not a formal recommendation: Staff the internal affairs unit with nonsworn personnel, perhaps retired judges or lawyers. Today, police officers rotate through IA, often leaving unfinished investigations for a novice to take over. It makes a great deal of sense, but Cordell was smart not to push for it because it'll take some getting used to.

On Wednesday, panel members credited Minnesota with making strides toward improving the system. In 2009, a new state law created a "bill of rights" for those under guardianship or conservator care. The law added more monitoring and made it easier to challenge bad decisions. It requires guardians and conservators to register and provide disclosures to the state courts. Unlike some states, the legislation did not require certification of professional guardians.

There is much dry humor and plain, driving storytelling. The titles of the stories -- "Blood Drive" "Fetching Raymond," "Fish Files," "Casino," "Michael's Room," "Quiet Haven," "Funny Boy" -- contain some of that humor, with double meanings on much of them. "Fish Files," for example, comes from a lawyer's term for cases that have been sitting too long, but that's not all that stinks in the tale. In "Fetching Raymond," there's the use of fetching as in picking up and also in the sense of charming, which is how Raymond has tried to get through life. "Blood Drive" turns into a road trip with a different ending than imagined.

øA: We've won some enormous victories. If you were to go back and look at the rates of cardiovascular disease and how they've fallen steadily over the last 25 years, there were two big factors. Changes in lifestyle, such as less consumption in meat, saturated fat, and smoking rates that have declined substantially. That's had a huge impact. And fabulous developments by industry. The modern pacemakers and defibrillators, the statin drugs, the better blood pressure drugs. All of these things have had enormous impact. Now the progress has slowed. Cancer has been a tougher road. There have been a lot of improvements, but they've been small and incremental. The really bad actors in cancer are still bad actors: pancreatic cancer, certain forms of lung cancer. We are extending lives of those patients, but we're not yet curing most patients. We need some breakthroughs here.

But MCs on Coachella's hip-hop undercard, including Compton's Kendrick Lamar and Harlem's ASAP Rocky, also have the potential to emerge from the fest as major new stars. With peers including Azealia Banks, producer araabMUSIK and gloomy crooners the Weeknd and Frank Ocean also on the bill at the festival in Indio, Calif., this is the best year for hip-hop and R&B in Coachella history. That's an ironic twist considering that the festival came to hip-hop late in the game — 2010 was the first year Coachella featured a headliner from the rap world (Jay-Z) since its 1999 founding.

Irony No. 2: Ohio taxed only about 8,000 estates in the 12 months that ended in June 2009, though about 110,000 Ohioans -- albeit of all ages and financial circumstances -- died in calendar 2008. The reason for the anomaly: Ohio doesn't collect tax on an estate unless its net taxable value is greater than $338,333, according to the Taxation Department. (The Census Bureau reports that Ohio's 2009 median family income was about $57,000 -- and the median value of an Ohio owner-occupied housing unit about $135,000.)

Epically restless, loud and with a gore-sentimentality ratio John Woo might envy, the South Korean '30s-'40s-era war extravaganza "My Way" is combative to a thematic and stylistic extreme.

Their road from rivals to friends is told over numerous lengthy, Cuisinart-edited scenes of chaotic struggle, small-world reunions and preposterously whisker-thin escapes.

Maya Lee, 13, an eighth-grader at Greenbelt Middle School, said she joined Emerging Young Leaders because most of her family members are in AKA. She likes the sense of community among the girls in the leadership program.
In documents filed with the commission, McFaul's attorney, John Climaco, argued that the money in the ex-sheriff's campaign fund did not constitute political donations, but rather "ill-gotten gains." Both in the trial transcript and in a sentencing request, Climaco had indicated that his client intended to pay a $21,000 fine from personal funds and to empty the campaign fund for the restitution. While there is no evidence that either the special prosecutor or the visiting judge in the case objected to that plan, there's no record that they agreed, either. Retired Geauga County Common Pleas Judge Fred Inderlied told this page that he took no position on using the campaign fund for restitution.
"We went to Molokai last year because we heard it was smaller and slower paced, but there wasn't enough for us to do there," Stephanie said. "We really like Poipu. We rent a place for two weeks and just relax. And go to Lappert's a lot."
Dali Yang, a University of Chicago expert on China politics, agreed that the Obama administration is now obligated to take a stronger hand in human rights cases such as Chen's welfare. "But we'll soon find out how sincere the Chinese top leadership are in a variety of ways," he said, including whether local officials are punished for mistreating Chen, and the release of people detained for helping him escape.

The hero is a tough cop, a mixed martial arts expert named Cliff St. James, who learns of a murder. Trouble is coming, though, from a Category 5 storm that will wipe away evidence and what little interest there is in solving the crime.
Police officials shuddered at the thought of employing that technique on the sloped, tree-filled lawns of City Hall that were covered with scores of tents. And while it might push protesters out of the park, it would not have given police control over how they dispersed, the officials said.
Nonetheless, even as Broad is reportedly poised to make a significant gift to the city — promising to pay for the design and construction of the museum while an endowment takes care of annual operating expenses — he is also asking for something significant in return: a prominent piece of property that the museum would be allowed to lease for $1 per year for 99 years.

Likewise, France, the continent's second biggest economy, gave up too. Ousted President Nicholas Sarkozy, a showy and shrill cheerleader for austerity, made things worse by his own missteps. In the final days of campaigning, he got nowhere with an appeal for the far-right, anti-immigrant vote.

The community garden is located on the east side of Division Avenue underneath the PSE&G power lines. Borough Engineer Vince DeNave recently met with the gardeners to explain the scope of the expected project as well as its impact on the garden. According to DeNave, PSE&G went to “great lengths to understand us” and scale back the “laydown area”. Originally a portion of the garden would have fallen within the lay-down area, but now only a small section will be affected.
"We even have the old rhythm band instruments from that school. And this is a milk can from the old St. Albans Dairy, where my husband, Rusty, milked cows when he was about 13 years old. I think it's wonderful we're here and that the museum will be open to the public," Pendleton said.
Instead of her mother running for governor, her uncle ran for a third term, as Rice and Armstrong were still in the midst of shooting and raising funds for the film. His campaign put a halt to both.
Soak garment immediately in cold water, then apply stain pretreater and tamp. Stewart recommends flushing the area with isopropyl alcohol, tamping again, and letting dry. If the stain is on a pair of jeans, khakis or corduroys, Richards suggests rubbing with a bristled brush (tougher material can hold up to a little scrubbing). Wash the clothing in cold water, and repeat steps if the stain persists.
Between December 1999 and December 2009, Oregon employers didn't add enough jobs to fill Portland's Memorial Coliseum.
It’s been awhile since St. Francis Prep has been pushed in CHSAA Brooklyn/Queens. The Terriers lost their first league match since 2005 to rival Archbishop Molloy, only to come back stronger. SFP won a fifth straight league title, coming back to beat Molloy in a five-set final in which Colucci pushed all the right buttons. Then the squad went to Buffalo and reached its first state championship match since 1999.

This idea has bobbed along for quite a while -- for good reason. It could be a huge boon to Cleveland area businesses and the port. A ferry service would enable people and goods to traverse Lake Erie faster, at less cost and with a lower carbon footprint than the current land route -- and far more profitably.

Coburn offered his thoughts at the Senate Judiciary Committee meeting this month to consider Arizona Supreme Court Justice Andrew D. Hurwitz's nomination to the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. That hearing started in typical fashion, with the chairman, Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) and the ranking member, Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa), exchanging pleasantries. Grassley then announced his intention to vote against Hurwitz. His "primary concern" was a 2002 law review article "embracing and celebrating the framework for Roe vs. Wade" that Hurwitz wrote. The senator also remarked that President Obama's allegedly unconstitutional recess appointments of officials in January required him to apply a less deferential standard that Hurwitz could not satisfy.
softball, he taught me how to throw and how to bat. I may not have hit many, but I had the stance of a pro. Even now when I play slow-pitch, I still think of where my hands should be and where I need to stand. I had quite the arm, too. Once, during a practice when I was younger, I made a girl cry because I was apparently throwing it too hard, so I had to warm up with one of the coaches. What dad wouldn't enjoy that, even a little?
“The CDC indicated that some of the people who were ill ate at Taco Bell, while others did not,” the company said. “They believe that the problem likely occurred at the supplier level before it was delivered to any restaurant or food outlet.”

"I'm not one of those people who could sit behind a computer, and need to be standing up doing something," Bush said. "Cooking is fun, and it encourages that competitive edge in me."
Obama and the Democratic-controlled Congress spend an intense year ironing out a compromise that requires companies other than very small businesses to cover their workers, mandates that everyone have insurance or pay a fine, requires insurance companies to accept all comers, regardless of any pre-existing conditions, and assists people who can't afford insurance.
Tom Urbanowicz, bargaining chairman for Gresham-Barlow Education Association, came outside the school district building to greet teachers who had walked over from the high school.
I have to show respect to Freeholder Director Robert Damminger for getting this done with bipartisan support. The fact that the freeholders of both parties were in complete agreement on an issue this important shows me that he is an effective leader.
Administration officials have so far opted for a different approach, refusing even to acknowledge Chen's case or the fact that he appears to be in the protective safety of U.S. diplomats, although Clinton has raised his mistreatment in the past. That has renewed criticism that the White House has soft-pedaled the question of human rights when it comes to China or other repressive countries whenever expedience dictates it.
Gordon, who earned all-tournament honors along with Munger, led the Bruins with 17 points, eight rebounds and four steals. Arianna Mohsenian had nine points and Megan Arnoldy finished with eight.

You can order a combination platter if you want to try several different things, or choose from the appetizers, entrees, side dishes and about eight homemade desserts. Prices are extremely reasonable, there's a depth of flavor in every bite and even the falafel ($7) is a surprise. Instead of the usual deep-fried brown brick, it's a large, quickly fried round ball with a light, soft green, ground chick pea and fava bean center seasoned with fresh herbs. Same with the kibbi ($7). I'm used to an over-baked ball of lamb and cracked bulghur wheat, but Hage's is shaped like slices of meat loaf, loaded with sautéed onions and pine nuts and served with fresh yogurt and cucumbers. Delicious.
But as sales for food produced on smaller operations have exploded, a new set of food-safety challenges has emerged.
A couple months ago, I featured an easy way to brighten up a rolling suitcase with rubber stamps and fabric paint. Every week I receive letters and e-mails from crafty people who tried the idea and loved it.
Authorities say they are taking robust action to thwart copyright infringement of items such as films, music and clothing and claim a crackdown has netted 3,000 people since October. But the fundamental problem, Hollywood studios and many Chinese consumers agree, is that China's censorship policies and restrictions on home entertainment products make it nearly impossible for consumers here to buy legal copies of American films. The Motion Picture Assn. of America has estimated that nine out of 10 DVDs sold in China are bootlegged, and piracy rates for downloaded films are almost certainly as high or higher.
But an asthma attack leveled Rupp earlier this spring, and he has refocused on Des Moines.

The facility fell into disuse and was eventually acquired by a private developer. Various plans to either knock the building down and put up townhomes or refashion it as high-end apartments, were announced throughout the 1990s and 2000s but they never materialized.
The hit scored outfielder Erik Komatsu, who reached base twice and hit a sacrifice fly.
"My face and body kind of looks like a monkey," Ito said, "so from a young age everyone used to tease me, saying 'monkey, monkey'. But I wasn't really bothered because I really liked them, and somewhere inside of me I had this ambition to adopt one of their traits. So when I occasionally saw a monkey that could run fast, I knew I'd found it."

The idea of taking someone to court may seem overwhelming, but the court system really has tried to break down the process to make it as simple as possible, says Denver County Court Magistrate Alan Bucholtz. He penned a municipal brochure called "Small Claims Handbook: A Guide for Non Lawyers." It walks citizens through the filing process including which forms to fill out and how to serve the defendant.

Two members of Ma’s lab, meanwhile, are even starting to make names for themselves. Weisleder, a detail-oriented researcher who’s worked with Ma for several years, was voted the 2011 Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation Outstanding Postdoctoral Entrepreneur last month. Xiaoli Zhao, a postdoctoral fellow at the Ma lab, was given the American Heart Association’s Young Investigator Award recently.
And the unrest in Egypt shows that the market is still vulnerable to unforeseen events. The Dow fell 1.4 percent Friday, its largest drop in more than two months, because of concerns that the protests in Egypt could disrupt the global oil business. Egypt controls the Suez Canal, a vital route for oil tankers and cargo ships.

November has become Beaujolais time, largely due to always-contentious Beaujolais Nouveau being released on the third Thursday (yesterday). If the light, fruity, simple flavors of Nouveau certainly don't harm the holiday meal, they don't much help it either. For a few bucks more, you can stick with Beaujolais, get a more serious wine and derive far more enjoyment at the table.
And it isn't just online agencies that would have trouble with the legislation. Rubin says that the bill could also impose a "significant" burden on hotels and that it would be difficult to comply with the law, given the number of international hotels.

Rising shares outpaced falling ones by almost two to one on the New York Stock Exchange. Consolidated volume was 3.8 billion shares.
The olive-feta plate is something I would order every day of the week. Pitted kalamata olives dotted with gooey, mozzarella-like feta filled out a surprisingly generous order. The presentation, in a sharp paisley dish, was elegant without being pretentious. And the Brussels sprouts were the perfect accompaniment. Was it brown sugar in there? I couldn't quite tell, but it gave them an unexpected injection of sweetness.

With 16 career golds (14 gold), his immediate goal is to win three more medals and become the most decorated Olympian in any sport.
The 42-year-old closer, who regularly chases down fly balls as a pregame warm-up ritual, was seen later near the clubhouse propped up on Girardi’s shoulder. He had his right knee elevated for the entire ride off the field and when he was lifted off the ground into the cart.

He also bristled in the book at how he felt that Scorsese's film painted Robertson as the star and put the others in subordinate roles. Consequently, Helm refused to attend when the Band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
A: Yes, as a benchmark. For me, it's the most complete piece of architecture we've done. And again, it has modest aspirations. It's a simple building with a powerful presence. Our buildings are like that. Our buildings are quiet but the resonance you feel is bigger than a small building.

Thus, Harmony Wynelands is rare among Lodi wineries in that its lineup includes a riesling, the fruit for which Hartzell gets in Monterey County.
Sanchez and Ramirez said they also decided against Mexico because of the lack of good-paying jobs there. Sanchez made $9.80 an hour working for a landscaping company in the West Valley, a low wage by American standards but middle-class by Mexican standards. In Pennsylvania, Sanchez is working for his brother, who owns a small landscaping business. He is getting paid more, $10 an hour, but working fewer hours, 28 instead of 40. But he said that the money is still better than what he would earn in Mexico and that he hopes to be working more hours once they can get more lawn jobs.

The agreement with new managers for the Baltimore Grand Prix looked risky for city taxpayers when MayorStephanie Rawlings-Blake's administration signed it in February. With little visible progress since then on putting this year's race together, and with signs of dissent among the new race promoters, it now looks much worse. It's time for city officials to give up on the notion of holding another IndyCar race in Baltimore this year.
The people of St. Stanislaus took their money, bought the property, took their money, built the buildings, built the church. The archdiocese just wants to reclaim its property.

Bernadette Peters is excellent as the jealous woman.
The travesty of high tuition is that most of the extra charges aren't going for education.

Rivers' disappointing season, which landed him on my bench weeks ago, is just one of several implosions that have rocked countless unsuspecting fantasy owners.

Wornum says he had no qualms -- "none whatsoever" --about leaving his son, Arthur, alone to continue on the show. At the beginning of the season, Arthur weighed 510 pounds. Taking his body mass index into account, Arthur was the biggest contestant in the history of the show. During the season, Arthur has struggled at times, as his size made some of the workouts especially challenging. Though in the episode that aired last week, Arthur had a breakthrough weight-loss of 20 pounds.

In the late '70s, Nelson boosters started tidying up the town's then-bedraggled old buildings.

And most of all, it assumes that McCown's performance against the Packers would have been a winner against the Chiefs, Broncos and Seahawks. That's highly debatable.

Whedon keeps a tight rein on some potentially unwieldy material, and the result is a film that simultaneously should please purists (one of which he is) as well as those who aren't necessarily comic-book aficionados. He also stays true to the characters while establishing a tone that's very much his own.

That's only modestly higher than the overall European average of 100, but the gap is large enough to produce a huge difference in the proportion of geniuses.

That is precisely why it is so important to understand what happened in Chile, which has a history of huge earthquakes. The previous one, in 1960, had a magnitude of 9.5 and caused widespread destruction. Chileans responded with better construction codes, better structural and earthquake engineering; buildings were made with massive reinforced concrete frames and backed by numerous reinforced concrete walls, called shear walls. However, over the last decade, more fanciful architecture and financial pressure to reduce costs have resulted in new buildings with fewer and more slender shear walls.

They were overwhelming for Barack Obama, but Congress is still languishing with a 27 percent approval rating."

The poor usually don't vote in large percentages. Neither do young people. But now, if you're illegal, you're going to swing the election? But Roger asserts just that. George Washington didn't need a voter photo. Neither did Jefferson or Lincoln or Nixon for that matter. But now if we don't want to have a photo ID depressing voter turnout, its only because Obama's election depends on "The War Against Voter Photos." Republican designs to make it harder for people to vote aren't mentioned.

For many, the student loan burden is crippling. If they can't find work, they can defer payment on their loans, but interest keeps adding up on the unpaid balance. If they find work, they often can't pay the basics - rent, car loan, health care and student loan. Instead of their education lifting them into the middle class, it too often suffocates hope.

You may have heard about the Catholic church's stand against a Health and Human Services policy that will require religious institutions (not churches) to provide provide health insurance to their employees which includes subsidized contraception, sterilization and coverage for abortion-inducing drugs. In it's grandiosity, the Obama administration thinks that giving the church an extra year to comply with its policies will be enough to satisfy the poor benighted bishops. I think Obama miscalculated on that one, and I pray that the church will continue to stiffen it's spine and resist this overreach.

In the end, both of these awful cases boil down to stunning neglect, irresponsible behavior and a criminal indifference to life.
S. Dallas Dance is young. He will be just 31 when he takes the helm of Baltimore County's school system. And he has not stayed in any one place for long — a couple of years teaching, a couple as a principal, a couple each in administrative posts in Virginia and Texas. He had to get a waiver from the state because he lacks the minimum three years of teaching experience required to be a superintendent in Maryland. Moreover, he was selected through a completely closed process; the only inkling most Maryland parents had of his existence came when he appeared at a public meeting in Howard County, where he was also up for the top schools job. His hiring in Baltimore County was announced less than 12 hours later, and at that point, he was already on a flight back to Houston. For Baltimore County parents unhappy about the way their schools have been run in recent years, that adds up to a heap of worry.

The European "crisis" is back. Actually, it never went away -- and won't for many years. The problems are so deep and pervasive that there is no easy or obvious solution. Government debt and deficits in many countries are not sustainable, but the usual remedies of cutting spending and raising taxes -- aka "austerity" -- may make matters worse by deepening already severe recessions. Europe is caught in a trap that promises more political and social unrest.

"Most people are going to look at price first," he said. "They're going to hit the 'Economy Super Saver,' especially if they travel once a year and want a low fare.

Kaptur, who's also 65, can fill that role. Though ideologically similar to Kucinich -- they both, unfortunately, embrace protectionism on trade and wishful thinking on entitlement reform -- Kaptur is a Capitol Hill insider: the No. 2 Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, a powerful position that has consistently benefited her current constituents. Earmarks may be shunned in today's Washington, but the clout of an appropriator is not going out of style. Kaptur also has a proven knack for assembling coalitions at home, bringing together business, labor, university and government officials behind common goals, such as Toledo's promising solar energy industry. That ability differentiates her from Kucinich.

Vermouths, sweet and dry, also belong on the aperitif bar, and most liquor stores offer several brands. Dubonnet, Cinzano and Martini & Rossi are all vermouth manufacturers, offering both sweet (red) and dry (white) styles. The exact contents are proprietary, but the base is fortified wine. Sweet vermouths tend to have rich, warm caramel, coffee and spice notes not unlike those found in colas, while the dry vermouths tend to be largely herbaceous. Both styles are served on the rocks, with or without a splash of soda water, and typically with a twist of orange or lemon.

Shaquille O'Neal, Chris Dudley and Jerome Lane, former Cavalier bricklayers all, are ready examples.

Your sacroiliac joints bear much of the weight of your upper body and act as shock absorbers when you move. They let you wiggle when you walk.

Santorum, of course, is not in that box in three districts, so theoretically, he starts off with a nine-delegate deficit (three districts, with three delegates for each). That’s not counting his potential problems in other parts of the state, including the Akron area, where he can only qualify for some but not all three of the district delegates. If Santorum gets the most votes in those districts anyway, look for him to appeal to the Republican Party to follow the will of the voters and award the full roster of delegates anyway.

Caltech seismological engineer Tom Heaton said the tragedy would provide unprecedented data on how buildings hold up under long periods of shaking.
Hair (mine). Clearly the reason I was hired in the first place. It's literally stopped women in their tracks. I'd call it chestnut, and it's starting to show some grey. I had some No. 7 (European scale) light-brown highlights added for a T.V. appearance that never happened. But I let the color grow out for fear of looking like a tri-colored beagle or something. I try to get it cut once a month, by either Carlos Gallegos ($20, including tip) or Barbara Venezia (free). A little Aramis hair-thicking gel in the morning and I'm good to go. I find blow driers really do damage, so I won't have one in my dressing room. I'm not messing around with the "franchise."

The televised debate is traditionally a high point in France's presidential election campaign, offering voters the only chance to see the candidates up close and trading barbs around a table. In 2007, over 20 million people, or about half of registered voters, watched the debate between Mr. Sarkozy and Ségolène Royal, Mr. Hollande's former partner and then the Socialist candidate, which went on far beyond the two hours allotted in the TV schedule.
The biggest question is Szalay's push for the county to invest $500,000 in the Ose-run Gibson Ranch over five years. County documents suggest that the ranch has unfunded deferred maintenance of only $290,000. Why the $500,000? And shouldn't there be a discussion of dedicating some of this funding to other park units in need of repairs?

I remember fondly the truffle Kobe beef sliders ($12) that Lewis put on the menu. They are one of the few things retained in the new menu, but they're a mere shadow of what they were.

It sounds like a superhuman workload worthy of Thor's godly lineage, but "Cabin in the Woods" and "Red Dawn" are leftovers from before Hemsworth shot to stardom when he was cast as the Marvel Comics hero. The two releases were delayed for years because of MGM's bankruptcy, leaving the 28-year-old Australian actor a little edgy about how those older performances of his will play with audiences.
Another favorite is the baseball-sized banh cam, or sesame balls. These spheres of rice flour dough are stuffed with lightly sweetened yellow (mung) bean paste, then rolled in sesame seeds. A few deep-fried seconds later, presto! Dunk in coconut-caramel sauce, a Jade creation. This combination of crispy/chewy/sweet/savory is first class.
There's no way the American government would ever actually build that design, is there?

Cabo Pulmo, a remote knob of classic Baja landscape with an underwater world singularly blessed by nature, slumbered for decades on the peninsula's East Cape. It rarely made a blip on the tourism radar except for avid fishermen, divers, and in more recent years, windsurfers and adventurous tourists from Los Cabos, about an hour's drive away. Despite a valiant, and successful, effort by Cabo Pulmo's residents and fans to get the federal government to protect its uniquely rich waters as a marine national park in 1995, today it is the target of massive development that would plant 30,000 hotel rooms — equivalent to another Cancun — on the sand dunes, along with a marina for 490 boats, shopping centers and two golf courses.

Meticulous preparation as well as high standards are what make his sushi so good. Fanatical about the smallest details, he makes his associates hand-massage octopus for 45 minutes before it is considered ready to serve. And one assistant talks of preparing egg sushi that was not up to the master's standards 200 times over a four-month period. The first time Ono said it met the mark, the man cried.

Like so many Brits, Whale was - and is - a devoted soccer fan. He even played semiprofessionally and coaches sometimes.

"I thought: I'm going to watch this team and see what happens."

Millionaire players with a billionaire owner scold us for not sharing our depleted entertainment budgets with them, when they ply their trade in a state-of-the-art building we taxpayers financed. We gave them the arena in exchange for their paying the operating cost, and now we're paying the operating cost as well.

Wisckol, Martin. Register's chief political reporter. We go back to our days together at San Diego State and, as such, share nuclear secrets - that is, stuff about each other so powerful that the release of such an information warhead by one party would prompt immediate retaliation, resulting in mutually assured destruction. I'm the only one allowed to call him "Marty." Fun fact: plays guitar and trumpet and sings like Satchmo.

As Batum waits to see how the lockout drama plays out, he’s looking forward to getting back together with the French National Team led by head coach Galen Hurley.
The current debate over same-sex marriage has been framed as a "civil rights" issue, but this is incorrect. Civil rights are defined as the extension of 13th and 14th amendment rights to minorities, where minority status is based on race, religion or ethnic background. Lifestyle choices do not fall under this definition. This bill protects religious institutions from being forced to "solemnify" same sex marriages, but by addressing the personal rights issues of homosexuals through the redefinition of marriage as opposed to the use of civil unions, the state has now put itself in the position of "solemnifying" a life style choice. By electing to do this, the bill over steps the government's responsibility to protect an individual's basic constitutional rights and makes the government the promoter of morality, which is a clear violation of First Amendment separation of church and state.
But Jefferson's situation is far more complicated. The school is home to the state's only majority African American population of students, and many residents have been disappointed by unfulfilled expectations of a series of unsuccessful reorganizations at the school.

Circulation numbers affect advertising rates at newspapers, which count print ads as their main source of revenue.

Standing a few feet away, Harding athletic director Paul Trina — who has seen roughly a dozen NFL players through his school’s corridors — was nodding and smiling along with the memory. All day today, people had called and said, How about Mario’s catch? Each time, the AD’s reply was blunt.

"The Drowned Cities" is not for the faint of heart or possibly even for readers at the lower end of the recommended reader age spectrum. It is far more violent even than "The Hunger Games" conclusion, "Mockingay." The action is oftentimes barbaric. Amputations are common. Even more bodies pile up as a result of atrocities committed with acid and, of course, guns. Many of the book's minor characters delight in torturing their victims, pouring flesh-eating chemicals down bare-skinned backs and smashing their faces into the dirt. At one point Mahlia notes that surviving only creates more killing.

A few of the items did manage to lose my attention. Fish and chips ($18) had a good concept - crisp shoestring fries as the chips for three sizable pieces of breaded cod - but the batter clumped at the edges, resulting in all bread and no fish in several bites. A 12-ounce slice of prime rib ($25) was moist and cooked rare, as ordered, but two or three of those ounces were an excessive amount of fat at the lip.

The Hawks said it was difficult not to respond with brute force against Torres, especially considering he wasn't penalized and remained in the game.

I have never been a member of a labor union, and have run my own small business during my professional life, but I still have a hard time believing that the "business community" should be the sole arbiter for what is best for San Diego. I would imagine that labor unions represent a greater number and more personal interests of the average citizens of our area than the members of the U-T editorial board or the leaders of the business community.

It seems hilarious to bring up in polite conversation. I haven't been able to find a way to deal with that. It's definitely informed the music of late."

Klett's pairings of recent and old views of the city deliver jolts of optimism, despite the many architectural deformities that have crowded the cityscape in the past century. Much of the show is contained in the paperback "After the Ruins, 1906 and 2006: Rephotographing the San Francisco Earthquake and Fire" by Mark Klett, Philip L. Fradkin and Rebecca Solnit (University of California Press; 134 Pages; $24.95).
Born in Mitchelstown, County Cork, in 1928, Trevor spent his childhood in provincial Ireland and draws much of his material from that region still. Now, with "Love and Summer," his gift of empathetic attention to the lives of "little" people remains on full display. The principal figures here are Ellie Dillahan, an orphan from the hill country married to an older farmer, and Florian Kilderry, a half-Italian photographer preparing to leave his inherited home. They meet by accident in the small Irish town of Rathmoye in the mid-1950s; the two are drawn to each other, and their shy secretive courtship comprises the bulk of the book. Both characters are cautious yet, in their dreams, daring; neither understands the stakes of the romantic game they play, and neither is practiced at love. Nor do they understand how closely they are being watched by others in the town.

Christie said the session should also examine controversial bills on school choice and affordable housing but focus on property taxes.

The film is deeply personal for Hirsch, who acknowledges that he was a bullied child. His empathy is palpable as he relates the film's primary stories: 12-year-old Alex's daily plunge into middle-school hell; 16-year-old Kelby Johnson enduring verbal and physical abuse after coming out as a lesbian at 14; 14-year-old Ja'meya Jackson resorting to extreme action in her distress over daily harassment; and the suicides of 17-year-old Tyler Long and 11-year-old Ty Smalley, leaving devastated families in their wake.

About five blocks west of Brick Lane in Shoreditch, Bramwell steered me to Boundary and Redchurch streets for a look at No. 2-4 Boundary. That's where British design star Terence Conran -- who has called Shoreditch "London's new Soho" -- joined with collaborators Vicki Conran and Peter Prescott in 2009 to open a striking food-and-lodging project. On the ground floor, the casual Albion Cafe and market were packed with lunchtime diners. Just upstairs lay the stylish Boundary Rooms hotel (12 rooms and five suites, each done in the style of a different modern or contemporary designer). On the top level, the Boundary Rooftop, a 48-seat bar, grill and garden, was awaiting better weather. Meanwhile, in an enormous space below ground level, the fancier Boundary Restaurant was offering French cuisine.

A. Sao Paulo is a walker's paradise with wonderful public transportation. The traffic is absolutely terrible, but you can circumvent that by taking the subway. My parents had a house five minutes away from the beautiful Aclimacao Park, in the neighborhood of the same name, near downtown Sao Paulo. The park has a gorgeous lake in the middle and is surrounded by dense, thick trees, not unlike Central Park. About a third of the population there is Korean. The neighborhood next to it is Liberdade, which is kind of like Asia-town. I went to a school next to the park and after school I would walk to the padaria down the street to feast on salgadinhos, which are essentially meat pies and pastries. On Saturday afternoons, I'd go to the art house movie theaters in downtown Sao Paulo, which would show foreign films, mostly from Europe. On Sundays, my family and I would go to the farmer's market in the morning, and then spend afternoons at the University of Sao Paulo, with its endless green lawns, where my parents and their friends would play volleyball.

Americans were shocked and saddened by the tremendous loss of life on Sept. 11, and by the unimaginable cruelty of those who planned and executed the attacks. But the more primal response was that of fear: fear that this assault on our basic sense of safety and security was just the beginning, that we would face more and deadlier attacks in the days and years to come. It came on the heels of the assaults on the U.S.S. Cole and on two American embassies in Africa, and it spoke to an escalation in a conflict we did not understand and did not know how to deal with.

I think the social thing is obviously huge. Players are really used to being connected to all their friends, all the time. When I first had email, I’d check it once a day, just how we treat regular mail. With Facebook and things like that you could check in on what’s happen every second, so now we’re dealing that level of connectedness. We haven’t been great at keeping “WoW” outside of the game itself. We’re a little behind the ball and there’s a lot of room to grow in terms of using social mobile to enhance the game experience.

"At the time, there was ... a need for a certain voice, one coming from the perspective of young families, which I think Gilbert is largely made up of," she said. "I felt like I could provide that voice."
After diner's pay the bill, Clemmons sends them away with a little box of miniature cookies and candies. It's a generous gesture, adding a final flourish to a dinner destined to become a benchmark for a perfect evening in the Sonoma Wine Country.
The property borders the Union Pacific rail line and is just south of the Salt River. Metro light-rail trains whoosh by the property. Trendy condos and apartments have sprung up to the west, and those residents have pressured the city to have the family clean up the cars, construction equipment, trailers and ramshackle structures scattered across the dirt lot.

Leading environmental groups boycotted the DEP’s open call for resumes this summer, accusing the department of establishing the board to circumvent the work of its own staff scientists and undo the state’s tough environmental regulations.
Our poking into every nook and cranny soon leads us into the home office. There we scrutinize protected files, seeking the account numbers and figures we must have, but secretly wish otherwise. With budgetary papers in hand, we knowingly cross a personal boundary and, consequently, feel the pinch of our chagrin.

Not much has changed in the four years since. Obama has a big advantage among female voters, but he is way behind with white men. Romney doesn't excite them, of course -- he looks a bit too much like the guy in the expensive suit who comes in to announce layoffs. But, if Ted Nugent says Mitt is OK, they'll vote for the millionaire over the ukulele player any day of the week.
Studies suggest that religious beliefs are rooted in this intuitive processing, Gervais said. So, he wondered, would thinking analytically undermine religious belief as it overrides intuitive thought?
I spent a long time with the Vikings owner and Lester Bagley, the team vice president of public affairs and stadium development, on Wednesday as those meetings were going on, and I am familiar with many people working on the project.

On Sunday, The Times made public a database of "value-added" ratings for about 6,000 Los Angeles Unified School District teachers. Rankings from "least effective" to "most effective" were assigned to teachers based on an analysis of whether they consistently raised or lowered their students' scores on standardized tests. Teachers were allowed to review their scores in advance and post comments if they wished. We have excerpted some teachers' responses below. Their full comments and those of other teachers can be found on our searchable database at projects.latimes.com/value-added

The questions he asked Favre were "inside" football stuff. What was his "hot" read on a play bust or a "hurry"? Out of certain formations, could he call an audible against a shifting front? He worked more on his footwork with Favre than an athlete on "Dancing with the Stars." He worked on quickening his release.
With "Train Dreams," that great weirdo is back. This musical little novella, originally published in 2003 in the Paris Review, is set mostly in the 1920s, and in the logging camps and train-station towns of Idaho and of the Pacific Northwest. It is wholly Johnson's own.

Meanwhile, back in the offense, when the Broncos moved to an option-based offense because Tim Tebow was the team's starter at quarterback, the team's tight ends largely became ornamental in the passing game no matter who they were. With just 19 catches, Daniel Fells led the team's tight ends in receptions.

You will hear no standing ovations for Sacco in the room. And the Avs will hear some sighs of frustration from die-hard followers, if early results from an Internet poll by The Denver Post is any indication. Barely 30 percent of people who care about the Avalanche are genuinely enthusiastic about the retention of Sacco. General manager Greg Sherman, credited with trades that brought the team Steve Downie, Jamie McGinn and Varlamov, receives far better reviews from the public.
The biggest hurdle they had to overcome was themselves.
Of course, true believers can be the most dangerous kind, can't they? There are places in The Sword of the Lord where it was difficult for me to not see Rice as the enemy of what I believe is the gospel. This was particularly true in the chapters dealing with his reactions to the Civil Rights movement. Like most early fundamentalists, Rice was a son of the South, raised in a wholly segregated and white-dominated society. Still, he considered himself an "intelligent and kindly" moderate on the the issue of

Attacks on U.S. forces and others in Iraq since the U.S.-led overthrow of the regime of Saddam Hussein in 2003 have been linked to al Qaeda. So has terrorism elsewhere, including the suicide bombings that killed 56 people in London in July 2005, and the bombings that killed almost 200 people on commuter trains in Madrid in March 2004. Al Qaeda attacks also have occurred in Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Chechnya and Southeast Asia.

If a pair of reporters with no greater access to property tax data than members of the general public can uncover so many millions in lost tax revenue, there's no reason every local government in the state shouldn't be doing the same. Clearly, such a project would pay for itself in no time, and elected officials might discover that cracking down on assessments is a whole lot more popular with voters that broad-based tax increases when it comes time to cover budget shortfalls, state or local.

“Given that Santorum personally opposes birth control, wants to put doctors who perform abortions in prison, and wants to recriminalize sodomy laws to take on gay people, it sounds like he lives in the 1940s and not New York in the 21st century,’’ said one of the state’s most prominent Republicans.

In the aftermath, people talked about the outlook of businesses that burned.
Some have suggested that the move to AVI has nothing to do with funding our schools, that linking the two is little more than a political distraction. We respectfully disagree. In cities, counties, boroughs and townships across the country, property taxes are the critical linchpin to funding public education. Homeowners have a vested interest in assuring that children in their community receive a quality education, have a fair shot at a good-paying job and ultimately end up reinvesting in the neighborhood. That is why people who can, when they have children, move out of the city to the Pennsylvania suburbs or New Jersey, where the taxes are much higher but schools are much better because of the larger investment.
In seeking an appraisal, the district used Cleveland-based Hotel & Leisure Advisors to estimate the building's value for a hotel developer.

All of this is made possible by the people who participate in our Komen races and donate or volunteer for the cause. Women truly will be hurt if we aren't able to fund the programs that are saving the lives of women in Michigan.

That is significant because ever since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, the FBI has stressed the importance of working with leaders in the Muslim community as an important part of the battle against terrorism. The FBI review began last September after Wired.com reported that the FBI had discontinued a lecture in which the instructor told agent trainees in Virginia that the more devout a Muslim is, the more likely he is to be violent.
Still, it's clear that the new niche lessens the company's ties to the construction industry, which took a hit in the recession. Brightworks pinpointed growing areas within the stagnating commercial building market, focusing on university student housing, government buildings and data centers. Oregon has emerged as a popular spot for the latter because of its low-cost energy, economic incentives and available space.
The Columbus public schools found that some tutors had forged payment documents or were tutoring students in poorly maintained buildings.
DRIVING UNDER SUSPENSION, MAYFIELD ROAD: At 9:15 p.m. April 19, an officer saw a car being driven with an expired tag on its plate. The tag was found to have expired on Oct. 21, 2011.

Finally, I helped successfully defend Missouri's Historic Preservation Tax Credit, which has done more than any other program to revitalize formerly dilapidated urban neighborhoods, creating jobs and putting abandoned buildings back onto the tax rolls.
Veterans courts go further. They are the latest of California's "collaborative justice" courts for specific kinds of cases, such as domestic violence, elder abuse and mental health. Vet courts are modeled on drug courts, the best known of the specialty courts. Courts that divert defendants into treatment programs cost more to operate than regular courts, studies have found, but can save money over the long run by keeping people out of prison and reducing repeat arrests.
Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam complained at a Cabinet meeting that the effort will cost his agency more and provide fewer services.
This time, Christie said he plans to submit an executive reorganization plan to the Legislature to begin the merger process.

Cornyn, now is in his second term running the National Republican Senatorial Committee, does not plan to run the influential Senate campaign group when he is up for reelection in the 2014 election cycle. Many on Capitol Hill believe that Cornyn would run for the No. 2 spot, and potentially be in a strong position to secure it if Republicans take back the majority in the 2012 elections.
Woody's Waterfront started as a tiny bait house for anglers doing their thing along Blind Pass, a rocky little inlet carved out by a ferocious hurricane in 1928. Back then it was burgers and such. It's still burgers and such, only now they are accompanied by margaritas and live music six nights a week. Servers hustle through the patio, tight-set with high-gloss picnic tables and turquoise sun umbrellas, hefting paper-lined baskets of fried shrimp and the ultimate Woody burger (mushrooms, fried onions, bacon, cheese). But be forewarned: Their tagline is "We're so close to the water, your burger will get wet."

On her two prior solo albums, Annie “St. Vincent” Clark made it clear that she’s got a taste for Kate Bush-like sonic experimentation — and that she allows herself a certain inattention to melody. “Strange Mercy” transcends the limitations of the first two, not by offering a clutch of catchy tunes (though she could probably do that if she wanted to), but by overwhelming the listener with some of the most wigged-out soundscapes on a pop record in recent memory. Parts of the CD sound like Yes — particularly the synthesizer freakout that caps “Surgeon” and the near-symphonic chorus of “Northern Lights.” “Cruel” comes closest to being a straightforward song, but still threatens to dissipate in a magnetic cloud of overdrive. Clark has managed to make hooks out of her sonic phenomena, and you’ll find yourself anticipating the woodwind flashes, drum breaks and processed guitar solos just as you might a singalong chorus on a more typical pop album. Better still, “Strange Mercy” doesn’t flag, sustaining its mood (guarded but alluring) and its experimental pace (relentless) from beginning to end.

Violators will be brought before the Planning Commission. Penalties range from having their alcohol-serving hours cut back to, in the worst cases, having their operating permits pulled, thus shutting them down. Owners can appeal their penalties to the City Council.
It's obvious enough that the Bears would most like to play the only sub.-500 division winner in NFL history in their first postseason appearance since the 2006 season. The Seahawks won the NFC West despite a 7-9 record, finished the regular season with the league's 28th-ranked offense and 27th-ranked defense, and host the Saints in a wild-card game on Saturday at Qwest Field.

I have contacted the stores where I shop to request that they stop supplying plastic bags that are filling up all our waterways, forests, fields, streets and parking lots, and killing animals galore that try to eat the stuff. I also speak to other shoppers, urging them to make the call and carry their reusable bags. It is not as if I am asking them to ride their bikes to the store.
The Navy Veterans Association is also passionate. It says it won't take money from the United Way because it supports Arab and Muslim groups.

The Postal Service has already asked Congress for permission to make service cuts and reduce annual payments of about $5.5 billion to prefund retiree health benefits.

"They have the tools they need to keep this from becoming a much worse slowdown," Aaron Gurwitz, chief investment officer at Barclays Wealth, says of China's central bankers. "If they're able to manage the cycle and manage away from an export-oriented growth strategy, people will make a lot of money on investments in China."
"It definitely was a unique situation,'' Chris Duncan said. "But (dad) told me to be as honest as I can. And being able to pick up the phone and interview the pitching coach whenever I wanted, to get an explanation for what they did, obviously gave me a little advantage. But I certainly didn't agree with every move.''
Michigan residents mostly supported the loans to the auto industry, even when it wasn't clear the companies would survive. A December 2008 EPIC-MRA poll of 600 likely voters found 69% supported the first loan proposal and 26% were opposed. A poll by the same firm taken two years later found 65% of Michigan voters thought the loans were a good idea. That contrasts with national polls showing a slight majority of Americans opposing the loans.

The restaurant's appetizers are nearly all meatless, and two or three would make a meal. And the house-made desserts are worth the calories. -- David Farkas, Special to The Plain Dealer

It's not easy being that person, either the one giving the warning or the one receiving it. It's not easy, but it is part of what it means to be a member of a community, including the community of the church.

The Timbers would have been happy with a draw and one point against Colorado June 11. The Timbers had played the defending champions even at Jeld-Wen Field, but a foul call on the Timbers led to Colorado gaining a free kick and scoring the winning goal with just minutes remaining in the game.

The GSA paid $75,000 for a team-building exercise and $58,000 for audio-visual services (to play embarrassingly juvenile music videos starring GSA employees). To give it all a patina of high-mindedness, employees built 24 bikes to give to the local Boys' and Girls' Club. Except the GSA had to finesse its own red tape to do it. "If the government acquires property," the inspector-general report relates, "it may only dispose of that property pursuant to the Federal Surplus Property Donation Program -- created by GSA itself to enable all federal agencies to comply with the Property Act."

Scott’s father wipes his nose, and his mom keeps praying. Then she whispers Scott’s childhood nickname, a name she’s promised she won’t tell anyone, a name she calls him whenever he’s down, a name that always makes Scott laugh.

As the Morning Star makes a way through the mantle of night, the darkness surrenders to the light and fades into a dull gray, which gives way as God pushes the sun toward the horizon. Spectacular tints and hues of every shade color the sky as it awakens from its slumber and stretches its arms at the gentle call of God. Then, in response to the smile of God, in one majestic finale, the individual shades of color blend into one perfect light as the full-orbed sun bursts into view. A new day is born at the hand of God, who specializes in new beginnings.
This sequel turns out to be as cozy as a well-worn sweat shirt, as warm as a laundromat on a winter afternoon and as comforting as a favorite book one picks up again and again.
The growth has been even more dramatic at Columbus State Community College. The number of students age 50 and older increased more than 81 percent, to 1,506 students, between fall 2007 and fall last year. That age group is the fastest growing population at the school.

Cusack is saddled with a jet-black beard and omnipresently bulbous overcoat, but he manages to bring an inherent likability to the role. He's rewarded with some fun, tongue-twisting dialogue that Poe fans will no doubt appreciate. But a lurching plot and indecisive tone prevent him from ever rising above a slight portrayal.
As you can imagine, the choice of a glove is as different as the player choosing them. The webbing, the fit, the length, the color (red!), and so on are all reflective of the individual's tastes and position. Most players will have a gamer on hand -- self-explanatory -- and a future gamer they are working into shape. Matt Carpenter has had to get comfortable with a new first baseman's glove this season. Rick Ankiel, on the day he retired as a pitcher, grabbed a glove from Jim Edmonds, because he didn't own an outfielder's glove.
After a tense 20 hours of silence, a search plane launched from Australia’s west coast made radio contact with Abby Sunderland on Friday.

Maggiano's makes no bones about being an Italian restaurant. The minute the revolving door stops, you're greeted with recordings of legendary crooners such as Dean Martin and Perry Como. There's even a large portrait of "Ol' Blue Eyes" hanging over the reservation desk. The martini menu is fairly typical, except for the Red Delicious Apple ($10). What makes this different from an Apple Martini? It's made with Crown Royal whiskey, not vodka. Although it should be consumed slowly, the sour apple pucker and the cranberry juice gives it a crisp, clean taste. -- Greg Burnett

2. Girl & the Goat (Three Stars) 809 W. Randolph St., 312-492-6262. Stephanie Izard's long-awaited restaurant, following her "Top Chef" win in 2008, lives up to the hype. Girl & the Goat is exciting and fascinating, a casual atmosphere (waiters wear goat-logo tees) wherein modestly priced small plates give full rein to Izard's flavor-balancing high-wire act, alternately challenging diners with goat meatballs with anchovy and escargots, and soothing them with seared scallops over shredded veal. Offbeat desserts are delightful continuations of the chef's sweet-and-tart flavor aesthetic.

It would be reassuring to know that the person heading the draft, and orchestrating the potential trades that could arise, is the same person who will be charting the course for the coming years. A general manager will choose his coach, and the coach will choose his style of play. It makes sense for the team to draft and trade accordingly.

Knox said the board is modeled after the respected National Institute of Health's system, which awards grants and loans after a peer-review process.
The idea of the Jets trading up or down to land the player(s) they want can't be discounted. General manager Mike Tannenbaum made the biggest deals of the 2009 draft when he traded two picks and three players to the Browns in exchange for the No. 6 overall pick, which he used on Sanchez, and later dealt three picks to the Lions to move up and grab Greene in the third round.
In the bigger picture, Epstein and Hoyer have been clear about the ‘‘parallel tracks'' they're operating in their overhaul plan.

The fact is, the real culprit here is the rest of us — the voters. The Times would never have put the article on the front page had it not expected secret audio files and vaguely racist opinions to attract eyeballs in a way that tax plans never could.

Italians are famous for lingering over their exquisite meals, and Pietro Marcello lingers deliciously in this documentary as he establishes the lives and relationship of a serial jailbird named Enzo, who grew up on the tough streets of Genoa and has just been released from jail again. You hear his voice describing his hardscrabble childhood and you hear the voice of his wife. By the end of the film, when we meet Mary and hear about how they met, we can't help believing we're witnessing a great marriage, albeit not an Italian "Ozzie and Harriet" union.

Margaret P. Gilleo's letter "Moral Responsibility" (May 24th) hit the nail on the head. Like Ms. Gilleo, I was disheartened by the results of the study (which itself was deeply flawed), which simply passed the the blame to society instead of those who committed the abuses. Such a pass-off is ridiculous; it's akin to a convicted murder trying to have his sentence commuted by saying that violent television programs made him do it. Society didn't make these abusers do the things they did. They chose to do them. I'm glad others were similarly dismayed by this deflection of blame and failure to take any sort of accountability.

Pence had a two-out double and Ty Wigginton followed with a two-run single in the fourth inning to put the Phillies ahead 2-0.

It is so painful because I lost my job in 2010 and my wife has a great job -- which she constantly reminds me of. This other woman texts her, and now they are on Facebook and play online games.

“Today's ruling guts the no budget-no pay provisions that Californians placed into the Constitution,” Chiang said in a prepared statement. “It gives lawmakers the sole authority to determine if they've done their job and deserve their pay.

Fields himself wouldn't develop the land, he said, but would probably sell it to someone who would -- once it has road access.

The Republican coalition is smaller, but it's uniformly conservative. But there remains a divide between Democratic activists and non-activists. Non-activists are very moderate and include quite a few conservatives. Furthermore, non-activists make up the vast majority of the party and are ideologically situated right between the liberal and conservative "peaks" of each party's activist base. Republicans can win by attracting those moderate and conservative Democrats; in fact, the GOP is sunk without them. If Democrats can bring them securely into the fold, they are unbeatable.
Baum has been examined by a psychologist for the defense who determined that Baum's intoxication at the time of the crash was "pathological by any standard," and that his "consumption of alcohol was not a conscious act due to the effects of his alcoholism and the ingestion of Librium on his cog nitive state," according to that report.

Building ventilation standards of the early to mid-1900s called for 15 cubic feet per minute of outside air for each occupant. With the oil embargo of 1973 and spurred efforts to conserve energy, these standards were reduced to five cfms per building occupant, thereby increasing indoor pollution. The cfm ventilation standard was recently revised upwards by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers to a minimum of 15 cfms per person, and 20 cfms in office spaces.

Both of these movies have their flaws yet both still have a puncher's chance at stealing the Oscar. "Midnight in Paris" is light and fluffy, but gets a boost from being Woody Allen's biggest box office hit and Allen still gets a lot of love from the Academy, even if he won't show up for the show. "The Help" is elevated for tackling the weighty subject of racial tension in the segregated South and for being the highest grossing movie of the lot, but loses points for being just a little too cutesy and stereotypical. It is likely the movie's wins in the acting categories will let voters off the hook for passing it by for Best Picture.

Right before the year started, we walked to the school together so we could get our school schedules. While there I made a couple of friends and they offered me a ride home. I told them I came with my friend and asked if he could get a ride, too. They took one look at him and said there was no room (there was). I should have said, "No, thank you," and left with my friend. But I didn't. I asked him if it was okay if I went with them and he said yes, but I could tell his feeling were hurt. I chose to go with my new friends.
Berkshire paid $26.5 billion in 2010 for the 77.5 percent of the railroad it didn't already own. Buffett is "on the prowl" for large acquisitions after record earnings at Berkshire's railroad and energy units helped boost the company's cash hoard to $37.3 billion at the end of 2011, the billionaire investor said in a letter to shareholders in February.

The city already had jettisoned its streetcars in the 1950s, when its population was at a peak of a half-million. Rybak recalled that era in his State of the City speech last week, when he said Minneapolis needed to grow and that streetcars would better connect people to their communities.
What really happened is that greedy, incompetent and corrupt Democrats sued the state controller and, predictably, found some sympathetic judge to rule in their favor. Now, the Democrats in the Legislature determine whether their fake budgets are balanced so they can get paid.

The protesters recently got a semi-boost from the U.S. Supreme Court, which said in a civil case that the group's actions were offensive but protected as free speech. The Supreme Court also left the door open for states to keep the Westboro folks at a more palatable distance from grieving people. The majority of states have done just that -- but not Oregon. When Oregon tried to pass a helpful and compassionate buffer bill this spring, the effort died when Senate leaders got spooked about Oregon's overly generous constitution. Mourners here remain legally unprotected from in-your-face funeral protests.

"Of course you take military action" if sanctions and internal opposition fail to dissuade Tehran from making a nuclear weapon.

Purists may sit on their hands, but Schiff argues persuasively that standard histories of last century's music betray tired prejudices, including the divide between commercial popularity and artistic integrity, difficulty and accessibility, control and spontaneity. Ellington straddled this divide. He played the Cotton Club and Carnegie Hall, in dives and cathedrals. He wrote "In a Sentimental Mood" and concert works such as "Black, Brown and Beige," a musical narrative of black history from Africa to Harlem.

My comment is about "Do the job right" (Sound Off comment, March 21 Journal), concerning AmerenUE trimming trees in the St. Peters area. People need to understand, coming from a public utility worker that does not work for Ameren, the trees are usually trimmed due to the fact that they are in the utility right of way. The trees should not be planted in the utility right of way; they should be away from the power lines. For us that do not have trees around power lines, we could look at it another way: part of my electric bill goes to paying for the tree trimming for people that do plant trees in the utility right of way. If they are in the utility right of way, they ought to be cut down, because that's part of my bill, being directed to the expense of trimming the trees. People need to think about that. The utilities are affected.

She was in DeLisle when Hurricane Katrina struck: Seven members of her family made their way, partly swimming, to a truck to try to find safer ground. Echoes of that story surface in "Salvage the Bones," which does a masterful job, in its closeup sibling relationships and deep understanding of the legacy of place, to speak to the damage Katrina wrought and what it meant. It may be a better fictional reckoning of Hurricane Katrina than any other, and do a better job of coming to grips with that disaster than we have yet seen for 9/11. It was that resonance, along with a singular writing style, that made it the National Book Award selection.

Suppose you elect to win the opening lead in hand and cross to dummy with a trump, East discarding a heart. You now lead a low diamond, inserting the king when East follows low. When it wins, continue with a diamond. Since East has no more trumps, you can win any return and use your club entries to ruff two diamonds in dummy. That gives you 12 tricks - five spades, three clubs, a trick in each red suit and two diamond ruffs.

I'm not saying there aren't groups out there that could fulfill all this, and in fact, I wonder whether the city identified and approached likely bidders. Still, 31 is a lot of rec centers, especially since many are aging facilities. The term "as is" gets repeated a lot in the request for bids.

In a nutshell: Given the success of the hit TV series "Mad Men," it's a wonder that it's taken this long for a retro cookbook celebrating 1960s cookery to come out.

Venture north of San Pedro and boom -- you're out of blue-collar territory and onto the genteel slopes of Rancho Palos Verdes, snaking along the not-at-all-smooth blacktop of Palos Verdes Drive. First, you exit at Trump National Golf Club and park in the free lot on the left. Alongside this ritzy golf course and restaurant is a network of public trails.

Of course you could play golf here, too, if you don't mind green fees of $215-$275 for morning starts. Your second stop, father north and west on Palos Verdes Drive, is the Wayfarers Chapel. This is a small but remarkable church – almost all glass walls and skylights, with light filtering in through flanking coastal redwoods.

Two melancholy Danes share center stage in “Flame & Citron,” a fascinating film by Ole Christian Madsen, but neither one of them is Hamlet.

I could have been vilified but I wasn't. I came away thinking the general public are OK. Then, since I didn't have many things at that time, I started to think about what else makes us human apart from being consumers. What I started to ponder was compassion and kindness.

"Now he's like a seven," said Anders, "but he started off at a one. He had never sung in his life. He was like, 'I need to know that I can do this before I sign on.' So I went to his house to hear him sing and even though he was completely green as a singer, his vocal cords were amazing. He had this voice that blew me away. It was the most powerful voice I had ever heard. So loud. He could do anything and go as high as we wanted. It was like a kid discovering he had a new toy. I left there super-pumped knowing that not only could we make him pass as a singer in the movie, but we would blow people away with what he could do."

But in 2006, the league sold its two debt-free stores in Portland to purchase a $2.9 million commercial building in Beaverton.

NCAA prospects: The selection committee didn't do the Cardinals any favors by sticking them with a No. 16 seed in one of the first four games played Tuesday and Wednesday. Lamar was the No. 3 seed heading into the Southland Conference Tournament, but emerged with the league's automatic berth in the NCAA's 68-team field after knocking of No. 4 McNeese State 70-49 in Saturday's championship final. Lamar counts on James for his offense and has gone 10-3 in the games when he has scored 20 or more points.

Much like Seton Hall, Saturday's results certainly didn't bode well for the Bulls' candidacy. South Florida has to hope that the Selection Committee gives them points for having to play 11 games without Jawanza Poland to start the season; five games without Anthony Collins and three games without Augustus Gilchrist. Those are the Bulls' three best players. If the committee does that and thinks that the Bulls are impacted so greatly by having them on the floor, USF will be in easy. But their profile is mediocre, they've benefitted from an unbalanced conference schedule and they have a 2-9 mark against the RPI top 50.

Meanwhile, back at the plot. Nick and Monroe arrive at Melissa's spacious home (big white columns in front), but it's dark and eerie. "This is so the part of the horror movie where the sidekick gets it," says Monroe.

DiNizio’s job? This veteran rocker, who has toured the country countless times and who recently received a key to the city of Carteret, has been brought in to teach Chase’s lead actors how to play — and how to behave — like a '60s rock group. A student of Mod culture and British Invasion pop, the singer is an easy choice for the task. It could be argued that that’s exactly what he did with the Smithereens back in the '80s.

I would hope this paper would show more forethought in the future when publishing pieces like this. Since pit bulls cannot speak themselves, perception becomes reality. Anti-pit bull laws and low adoption rates are determined, in large part, by public perception, and when such uninformed arguments like this get exposure, innocent animals can quite possibly die, languishing in shelters or euthanized. I can understand, to an extent, the writer's ignorance on this issues, but what I can not do is excuse it, as lives literally hang in the balance within the context of this discussion. Those lives may not matter to some, but they do to myself and about 99 percent of people of all races who have ever gone beyond there inculcated biases and had a genuine interaction with a pit bull.

CPS caseworkers spend most of their time dealing with traffic, paperwork and a 14-year-old clunky database called CHILDS, not with children and families. The job requires a certain kind of person, with critical thinking skills, a calm demeanor and a thick skin. It also requires a college degree, long hours and enormous responsibility. It might require a young woman to go into a dangerous community in the middle of the night, armed with a clipboard, and tell the occupant they've been accused of mistreating their children.

Once a symbol for prosperity, Solyndra became a synonym for failed lending practices, and critics alleged that the loan was pushed through by the administration even as indicators suggested failure.
Johnston has turned to the Sufi poet Rumi in his late music. In 1998, at the behest of guitarist and MicroFest founder John Schneider, the composer wrote "The Tavern," settings for voice and microtonal guitar of texts about the spiritual aspects of intoxication. The follow-up was another Rumi cycle, "Parable," for mezzo-soprano, violin and clarinet. The singer for whom that was written stopped performing before premiering it. Johnston told me during intermission that he then began to have doubts about the piece and withdrew it for a time.

For the Normandy district the cut would amount to one full-time teacher and 15 slots for low-income preschoolers, said Sharon Williams, executive director of teaching and learning for the district. The district would lose 15 percent of its free preschool spots, she said.

The film's staleness is partly because Hollywood hit us with the "Old West meets aliens" idea just last summer with "Cowboys & Aliens." But it goes deeper than that. Burroughs may have conceived his tale of a Civil War veteran who finds himself mysteriously transported to Mars (called Basoom by its natives), but its themes, character archetypes and effects have become so ubiquitous that the overblown production feels, perhaps unfairly, like a misguided attempt to reinvent "Star Wars" and countless other science-fiction series that anyone who was once an adolescent boy can probably recite for you.

Once that was done, we would go to the old rag bag and get all of the fixin's to do the very precious and delicate job of cutting and knotting a tail that wouldn't dive-bomb. We worried about our prized kite quickly plummeting to the ground. When that happened, it would send our spirits crashing with it. However, most of my kites didn't fall.

In fact, my secret childhood wish was to fly my kite as high as the circling planes.

The 1995 wedding of Kenneth Scudder and Kellin Defiel was a series of barely averted disasters, the worst being a flat tire on Kenneth's old beater while the couple were already late for their own reception.

Larger businesses in the heart of Silicon Valley suffer fewer direct impacts -- their buildings are newer and stronger, many of them retrofit with rubber isolators, their insurance better, their savings larger, their emergency plans more carefully laid. But they are not unscathed. Even if your building is standing, you can't run a business if you can't flush your toilets. You can't run a business if your employees can't get to work. Many types of manufacturing can't be done without water -- and industrial use comes well after emergency and drinking water in the rationing scheme. Business owners begin to consider alternatives.

No. 1 North Carolina (31-5) vs. No. 13 Ohio (29-7), 4:45 p.m., TBS: The biggest story line in this one, of course, is the health of North Carolina point guard Kendall Marshall, who suffered a broken right wrist (his non-shooting hand) in Sunday's win over Creighton. Ohio does a great job of forcing turnovers, 7.2 a game, which is tied for fifth nationally. If Marshall plays or even if he doesn't, expect the Bobcats to swarm.

Ohio is not all that proficient from long distance, but the Bobcats have to make three-pointers if they're going to win this. Keep an eye on Nick Kellogg, who makes 41.4% from beyond the arc. Ohio wants to keep this in the high 60s or low 70s.

When Should Surgery Be Considered and What Is Involved? In many cases, the conditions causing spinal stenosis cannot be permanently altered by nonsurgical treatment, even though these measures may relieve pain for a period of time. To determine how much nonsurgical treatment will help, a doctor may recommend such treatment first. However, surgery might be considered immediately if a patient has numbness or weakness that interferes with walking, impaired bowel or bladder function, or other neurological involvement. The effectiveness of nonsurgical treatments, the extent of the patient's pain, and the patient's preferences may all factor into whether or not to have surgery. The purpose of surgery is to relieve pressure on the spinal cord or nerves and restore and maintain alignment and strength of the spine.

Let this be yet another reminder for people to think about over-sharing. To me, it's obvious that connecting your Foursquare account with Twitter is tantamount to broadcasting your whereabouts. I've done that, but I did so knowingly. But it never hurts to remind people to put thought into whether they really want to publicly share where they are and, by implication, where they're not.
What's happening? One theory is hyperactive neurotransmitters, like dopamine, that help shuttle information into both short-term and long-term memory centers, change lanes. The visual information you are seeing for the first time ends up getting sent directly into long-term memory, before it is processed into short-term memory. The result: Your brain "recalls" the image of the Mayan temple from the long-term memory storage area and that tells you it's information from the past, not the present. Deja vu!

But perhaps readers simply need something beyond imagination and analysis: the will to believe in their own reading. I'm reminded of the ghost in "Hamlet," and how little we really know about him. Is the story he tells Hamlet -- that he is the spirit of his murdered father and should be avenged -- true? Is he a hellish apparition sent to lure Hamlet to commit an "unnatural murder" of his own? Or is he just a figment of Hamlet's imagination? No one really knows, and that's part of the fun. It's a very different play depending on which view you take.

If we want jobs in America, and the purchasing power that goes along with those jobs, we need to "care" and provide for our workers. The alternative is to condemn workers to a life of poverty from medical bills, or to ship the jobs to China where near-slave-labor conditions prevail and employers here won't have to be concerned with well-being of their "contracted" employees.

Paperwhites can be grown in potting soil, but do fine without; you can just set them on a bed of gravel, stones or marbles, watering only enough to keep the bottom of the bulbs moist. Containers need to be only 3 or 4 inches deep, and bulbs can be crowded together, sides touching.

* New Orleans over Minnesota tonight as the NFL kicks off the 2010 season. Defending Super Bowl champs haven't done well in terms of repeating -- the last time it happened was the 2005 New England team -- but they usually come out strong, having won the last six season-openers in the Thursday-night showcase.

In the first half of that game, Favre had a TD with no INTs and a rating of 83.3.One of this years, Favre will be physically diminished. Is it this year?

Reynolds wasn't happy with the change, but the single went on to sell more than 1 million copies. The follow-up single, "Fire of Love," only made it to No. 66, and Reynolds never charted another hit. "Endless Sleep," though, became a genre classic. It was subsequently recorded by British musician Marty Wilde and became a hit in England, and it has since been covered by numerous artists, including the Judds, John Fogerty, Billy Idol, Leo Kottke and Hank Williams Jr. Country singer Bobbie Gentry was playing in Reynolds' band in the 1960s when she wrote "Ode to Billie Joe," her Southern Gothic spin on the teen tragedy formula.

It’s a small business, but a big deal. There are firsts everywhere: It’s the first time two franchises will host a Super Bowl. The first time two states will. It’s the first Super Bowl in the Northeast. The first outdoors in cold weather. And it’s going to be ridiculously complicated and obscenely expensive. So, the CEO will have to raise piles of money, prepare and plan, be detail-oriented. Like Kelly.

Teacher evaluation policies embedded in HB 153 and Senate Bill 5/Issue 2 feature "value-added" measurement, which currently excludes teachers below the fourth grade and those who teach nontested subjects. It's supposed to measure student growth, but relies solely on state achievement test scores from one year to the next. Notably, statistical research presented at the ETS conference showed that "considerable error rates" in these calculations make value-added measures "unreliable." The report, by Mathematica Policy Research for the Institute of Education Sciences, warned against using this much-touted measure, stating that "more than 90 percent of the variation in student scores is due to variation in factors that are not under control of the teacher."

“Pariah” is a small movie, sometimes literally so – scenes are often framed in tight two-shots, or alternating closeups. This gives the film a sense of immediacy, but also eliminates detail – you want to see the decorations in these girl’s rooms, or the crowds in the clubs they go to. (The night scenes are also, typically of many low-budget films, simply too dark.)
Under the current system, billions of dollars worth of care is provided to people who cannot cover the full cost of their treatment, and those costs are passed on to everyone else.

To wait until next year to fill the vacancy would leave the district underrepresented during at least part of the 2012 session. Nixon could leave the seat vacant until it comes up for regular election in 2012 (the primary will be on Aug. 7 and the general election on Nov. 6, the winner of which would take office in January 2013), but that would leave the 15th without a House member for the entire 2012 session, an even more unacceptable option.

Irving's scoring and shooting are superior to his early rival for top rookie honors, Minnesota's Ricky Rubio. But Rubio's assists to turnovers ratio (8.3 to 3.3 when the game began) is much better than Irving's (5.2 to 3.5). He also possesses a mystery factor. Rubio is the Spaniard who turned pro at age 14, an age more suitable for female tennis players and gymnasts. Many of Rubio's assists are SportsCenter-ready dazzlers on lobs to forward Derrick Williams.

In Peyton Manning, the Broncos are trying to take the ultimate short cut. If Manning can play quarterback at the level he did before his neck injury, the Broncos can overcome some of their unfortunate draft picks of the past 11 seasons.

Or add them to chile oil to establish a savory backbone.

A: Your Armenian cucumber is actually a melon, not a cucumber, and it sounds as if your plants are not being pollinated. The flowers of melons, cucumbers and squash have separate male and female flowers. If the flowers open, and a female flower does not get pollinated, the small undeveloped fruit behind the flower will abort.

Hey, Hoynsie: Can you please explain why the MLB draft seems much like a crapshoot and teams in the NFL and NBA can build through the draft. Also, what really makes the Detroit market different than the Cleveland market? -- Eliot Clasen, Cape Coral, Fla.

In its own way, "Luck" is a masterpiece, but patience is required. That said, I still wouldn't place a bet on whether it will become a "Sopranos"-level sensation or draw only a small but passionate cult following. I wouldn't even lay a bet on whether I'll keep watching.

Lee can't pinpoint when the area started coming back. She just knows that at some point, tastes and wallets migrated from Budweiser, Coors, and Tecate to Modelos, Corona and the occasional Heineken. She still shakes her head in disbelief on a recent Friday night when someone brings up to the counter a six-pack of a fancy lager that goes for $9.
But in "The Hunger Games," Hemsworth isn't picked for the actual Games. But that doesn't mean he didn't hurt for his role of Gale Hawthorne, a love interest of Katniss, who worries about her from the homefront of District 12.
The author, though he plainly states he is a nonbeliever, nonetheless paints a picture of a typical atheist that seems more like the figment of a religious fundamentalist's imagination. In this one-dimensional portrait, atheists are incapable or unwilling to acknowledge that religion has ever served a useful role, promoted any positive behavior, or provided any solace for its adherents. This is just as insulting as the stereotype of all Christians as moralistic, repressed softheads.
BOSTON -- Fund investors who want to put their money to work as cheaply as possible have a couple of basic options. They can go with an index mutual fund or a comparable exchange-traded fund.

Given recent trends, Obama can point to a gradually improving outlook and Romney can cite his experience as a business leader and appeal to those concerned about their own financial plight.
Camby knows his body. He'll play when he's ready, you're thinking. And as much as the Blazers would have liked to have him in the lineup a week ago, demonstrating to potential trade partners that he's capable and healthy, as Saturday's development indicated he'd quit before being traded, what we have here is a passive-aggressive ploy that has no place here.

Erik, I know you would like to have the law changed. In October 1992, the Church at Pierce Creek took out a $44,000 advertisement in USA Today advocating that no one should vote for Bill Clinton for president. The ad argued, complete with scriptural passage citations to "prove" the point, that Clinton would follow non-biblical public policies and was thus a "sinner." People who voted for a "sinner," it concluded, committed "sin" also.

A familiar theme used by those opposed to opening new areas for oil extraction is that it won't do anything to address our immediate needs. The most frequently cited duration for new locations to result in tank-ready gas is five to 10 years. Couple that with President Barack Obama's assertion that we are producing more gas now than ever before. It leads one to do some basic math and realize the approvals must have been initiated whilePresident George W. Bush was in office.
The main goal of the OHSU experiment is to see whether implanting the stem cells is safe. Doctors plan to operate on six children, testing two doses of stem cells. Although doctors hope the treatment helps, it has never been studied in people and so has unknown risks and uncertain benefits.

The Republican field in this presidential contest leaves a lot to be desired  both in terms of candidates and ideas  and if Romney is to have a chance in November against Obama, hell need to stop mimicking his GOP rivals simplicity.
University High in Tolleson takes a more traditional approach. The school doesn't always accept students with the best academic records. The school looks for students with a strong desire to get ahead and a history of engagement in extracurricular activities, a strong indicator that students will finish high school, said Dennis Dowling, the Tolleson district's director of curriculum and instruction.
“One of our goals is to help people become aware of their responsibility of taking charge of their health and wellness through breast exams, mammography and regularly scheduled doctor appointments,” Gondek said.
"Little Broken Hearts" has a cinematic, often lonesome sound. Mr. Burton produced the album and co-wrote all the songs with Ms. Jones, working one-on-one over a month in Los Angeles. Blue Note didn't play matchmaker. Instead, their friendship began four years ago when Mr. Burton asked Ms. Jones and Jack White to sing on "Rome," his spaghetti-western soundtrack with composer Daniele Luppi.

First of all, el Chepe (the train) is patrolled by heavily armed state police officers who are there to stop any potential robberies or assaults.

That covers those who made the biggest contributions in their careers from 1947-1972.
He was placed on injured reserve in October, and the team was cautious in discussing his future, pointing out that neck injuries require extra care. Reese said Kiwanuka had been getting “good reports” during his rehab, but the final decision depended on whether he would be medically permitted to play and whether he wanted to return.
Stattitude: The national champion in five of the past six years also won its conference tournament. That might be good news for Louisville, the lone league champion in this foursome.
"This will be the thing he's most excited about," she said. The fact that he'll be watching, as will her children (who may visit what she hears is "a really great children's museum" in town), provides all the more reason to not dispense any of that "Sex" book Madonna during the show, if Janet Jackson's debacle wasn't enough of a warning.
"We get a significant number of our customers from northern New Jersey," DeSalvio said. "It is not a prospect we would enjoy."
We've also saved hundreds and hundreds of lives, especially of kids. That was another thing early on; I realized I couldn't be a neighbor in this community and watch my neighbors die, so we provide basic medical care for malaria and pneumonia.

It was at that moment when she left teaching to join Eggers in creating 826 Valencia, which organizes volunteers to help teachers improve their students' writing. Though Eggers may have been the organization's creative inspiration, he is the first to admit that Calegari was its practical leader. Calling it an "amorphous notion" before Calegari, Eggers watched as the woman with a "a thousand ideas a day" quadrupled the organization's volunteer base and budget.

Talk to people who have worked with him, and the first thing they'll mention is Schochet's age -- startling for someone who controls such a large portfolio. His thick beard does little to conceal his youthful face. And he seems more comfortable in jeans and a rumpled button-down shirt than a suit.

Two years after the recession officially ended, companies are adding fewer workers despite record cash stockpiles and healthy profit margins.
6:54 p.m. -- GIANTS 31, CARDINALS 19. Nice grab by TE Kevin Boss for his fifth TD of the season, a 10-yard catch. Boss jumped up for the ball -- after it's tipped at the line of scrimmage -- then easily walked into the end zone. The Oregon native has a large contingent of family and friends at this game -- the Giants' only one on the West Coast -- so this must be an extra-satisfying TD for him.
On Thursday, the Federal Aviation Administration said the same controller was on the phone at the time of the accident and that his supervisor was out of the room when the crash occurred.

And, remarkably, the two Ohio teams that once dominated were reduced to history. They've played only once in the last 50 years, with Ohio State winning 72-50 in 2006 in a game played in Indianapolis as part of the Wooden Tradition.
Prada designer Miuccia Prada founded the label, which takes its name from her nickname, in 1993.

Incumbents from states with closed primaries have reason to be sensitive to inter-party challenges if they stray from the base ideology. These days, it is the only political threat that seems to resonate with some. One of the major stories of the 2010 elections was successful internal party challenges to Republican moderates by conservatives: Utah Sen. Bob Bennett was bested by Mike Lee in the GOP primary in May 2010. Christine O'Donnell's primary win over Rep. Mike Castle almost certainly resulted in Democrat Chris Coons winning the Delaware Senate seat. Republican and Democratic moderates who used to align in cross-party coalitions often feel constrained by primary threats. The resulting ideological radicalization of Congress and strict "party voting" results in more than increased confrontation and less consensus: We have a Congress of ideologues representing a country of pragmatists who increasingly feel alienated by partisan rancor. Indeed, a Gallup Poll found that on the debt-ceiling debate, 82 percent of Americans thought members of Congress were guided by partisan advantage while only 14 percent thought they were acting out of what was good for the country.
To the film’s credit, too, it’s open to the awkward, honest — and not always flattering — moments of real life. Tom and Violet love each other. But that doesn’t mean they can’t be awful to each other or react badly when called on it. They’re a committed couple, yes, but the worst wounds always come in close combat.
Becky Bloomwood is a sparkly young woman breezing about Manhattan. She's happiest when she's buzzing into stores to score a dress, a coat, a bag. For her it's like an addictive aphrodisiac, the smell of leather, the swipe of a credit card. "When I shop," she says, "the world gets better."

To pretend that natural gas is a cure-all would be foolish. The methane problem illustrates why clean energy development and global warming are so complicated that there’s no single energy source that is sufficient to do the job. We will need an all-of-the-above energy strategy.

The allegations, many coming to light for the first time, underscore what has slowly emerged from earlier bankruptcy court filings, lawsuits, depositions and testimony in court: that since leaving rabbinical college at the age of 19, Dwek drifted from one scheme to another, with little concern for the consequences.

On Wednesday, more than 200 local priests and 20 U.S. bishops flooded the wings of the cathedral. A replica of the scroll sent from the Vatican was presented to Sheltz in front of the congregation, as was the traditional ring, pastoral staff and miter, the pointed bishop headdress.

Southern fried chicken ($17) had a spicy crunch, even though the herbs in the coating were a bit distracting. The pieces were set on a mound of limp collard greens that held the thigh, leg and breast above the loose puddle of white pepper mashed potatoes. They were so runny it was impossible to distinguish the potatoes from the gravy. To keep the coating crisp, I removed the chicken to my bread plate, which also contained a warm biscuit slathered in honey butter.
Perhaps most incredible is the price. The base price is just $13,600 for the LX, $16,500 for the EX, and $17,700 for the SX. The only option on the test car was carpeted floor mats (Why are these optional?) at $95.

A distinct gulf exists between Mr. Obama's overall standing and how some of his key initiatives are viewed, with fewer than half of Americans saying they approve of how he has handled health care and the effort to save General Motors and Chrysler. A majority of people said his policies have had either no effect yet on improving the economy or had made it worse, underscoring how his political strength still rests on faith in his leadership rather than concrete results.
Now, with the Republican Party in a budget bind, the GOP's plan is to raise needed revenues via wealthy donors ("State GOP not making rent," April 10). Republicans are clearly expecting to meet their needs by turning primarily to those with far greater means.

Prepare the beurre Colbert: In a small saucepan, reduce the veal stock over moderate heat to 1/4 cup. It should be syrupy. Allow the stock to cool to about 100° (just above body temperature). Put the softened butter in a bowl and add the reduced stock, using a rubber spatula to get every drop of the stock. Whisk until the mixture is smooth and creamy. Stir in the shallots and herbs. Add lemon juice, salt and pepper to taste. Leave the seasoned butter at room temperature while you cook the beef.

Well, I'd be surprised if they rode him very hard right out of the gate but I suspect Craig will do what he has always done. He'll hit. Right now there's a good opportunity for him to log some at-bats while Lance Berkman is out and I'd be surprised if the team didn't take advantage of that. They won't bury Matt Carpenter but Craig would appear to be in line for a good number of starts for the time being.

2. Rory McIlroy, Northern Ireland -- A year ago, McIlroy skipped the Players Championship after Chubby Chandler, then his agent, called it "the ninth or 10th most important tournament in the world." When he joined the PGA Tour before this season, he said he would again play in what the PGA Tour would rather be called "The Fifth Major," and he made it official with a commitment last week. He has played at TPC Sawgrass only twice, in 2009 and 2010, failing to break the par of 72 in any of his four rounds while missing the cut both times. When he left two years ago, he said the Stadium Course simply does not fit his game. … Rory is taking three weeks off before playing in the Wells Fargo Championship, the week before the Players. He will turn 23 on Friday at Quail Hollow, where he claimed the first of his three PGA Tour victories in 2010. McIlroy might enter the tournament as the No. 1 player in the World Golf Rankings, having taken over the spot last week without firing a shot after Luke Donald tied for 37th in the RBC Heritage. Donald could get it back this week in New Orleans. … Whatever caused his 77-76 weekend at the Masters, which left him in a tie for 40th, McIlroy probably was overdue for an off week, ill-timed as it was. Before that, he had finished in the top five 11 times in his previous 12 tournaments, including victories in the UBS Hong Kong Open and the Honda Classic. The only time he didn't, he tied for 11th in the Dubai World Championship, where he was suffering from the effects of dengue fever.

"When they went out of business, we knew those people had to go somewhere, so we decided to take the night."

To a modern eye, her books reflect many of the faults of her generation — "And Then There Were None" was originally titled "Ten Little Niggers" (which was also the original title of the poem changed to the only slightly better "Ten Little Indians"), and the British class system, still very much in place when Christie grew up, is often replicated in her books without question or argument. That said, there were no sacred cows — her murders were as socially diverse as her victims, and Poirot's greatest asset was that, as a foreigner, no one thought him important enough to guard against. Through him and his less-than-perceptive British foil, Hastings, Christie was able to dissect the famous British reserve and rigid dictates of class. The running joke that no one seemed capable of believing that, although he spoke French, Poirot was in fact Belgian, served as a perpetual admonishment against Britain's often dismissive relationship with its European neighbors.

Mr. Folman's film, "Waltz With Bashir," deals with elusive issues of dissociation, repressed memories and survivors' guilt -- in that sense it's a companion piece to "Adam Resurrected" -- by examining an infamous incident in the Lebanon war when Christian Phalangists massacred Palestinian civilians at the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps while Israeli soldiers surrounding the camps did nothing to stop them. Remarkably, the film is an animated feature, and the animation technique works brilliantly. (The blue-and-orange images that first fill the screen, a pack of ravening dogs running through the streets of Tel Aviv, are as powerful as any I've ever seen.) In a festival perched between present and past, risk-takers like "Waltz With Bashir" and "Slumdog Millionaire" show where the movies may go in the future.

When it came to the Police Department, the accountant found that expenses had dropped dramatically from nearly $120,000 between March 2007 and March 2008, to about $53,000 in the same period the following year. He attributed the drop to "changes in the coding of police related transactions."
Still, second marriages have become commonplace. Nineteen percent of marriages that occurred in 2008 were the second marriage for at least one spouse. Second marriages have their own well-known stressors. Children can be reluctant to accept a stepparent; raising kids leaves newlyweds little time to gain intimacy. One spouse may be paying to support children of the previous marriage or may want to preserve assets for them. And never mind the other baggage that people bring with them after divorce, whether it's fear of losing their independence or a bitter ex.

The rationale for the mandate goes beyond the issue of personal responsibility. It's also an integral part of Congress' effort to stop insurers from excluding people with preexisting medical problems. That sort of cherry-picking leaves millions of Americans unable to find affordable coverage. To combat that, the law requires insurers to expand their risk pools, offering coverage to all applicants at prices based only on their age, locale, family status and tobacco use, not their medical records. But these requirements could have the perverse effect of inducing people to drop coverage whenever they're healthy, signing up for policies only when they know they need expensive treatment. Such "adverse risk selection," as economists call it, would result in insurers covering only the sickest people, sending premiums through the roof. To minimize that problem, Congress added a requirement that all adult Americans carry insurance at all times.

We open with a quote tipping us off that this week's episode has its roots -- well, a few of them, anyway -- in the old Pied Piper of Hamelin tale. Fun fact: the pied piper tale is translated as Rattenfänger von Hameln in German. So says Wikipedia, at least. As we recall, the piper was hired to lure away rats with his piping, but when the Hamelin citizenry wouldn't pay him (a tax revolt?) he lured their children away, too.

There's nothing wrong with making the ratiocinating resident of 221B Baker St. a brawling badass, if the filmmakers had also honored Holmes' uncanny talents for deductive reasoning, his powers of observation and forethought. But the intellectual side of Downey's Holmes is represented by not much more than show-off blather and far-fetched "reasoning." Not a keen mind so much as a careening script.

He started 25 of those games, averaging 18.2 points and 7.7 assists in those contests — including a brilliant run in February when Lin, shortly after being inserted into the lineup, scored 114 points in his first four starts and 163 in his first six, making the former Harvard guard an NBA phenomenon almost overnight.

African Queen re-launched in Key Largo -- Visitors to the Florida Keys can again take a ride on the African Queen, the iconic original vessel from John Huston's classic 1951 film by the same name starring Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn. Registered as a national historic site, the African Queen recently received a major $70,000 restoration project that included structural, mechanical and cosmetic repairs. The African Queen has an interesting 100-year history that began when it was built in 1912 at England's Lytham shipbuilding yard. Originally named the Livingstone, it served the British East Africa Rail Company shuttling cargo, hunting parties and mercenaries on the Ruki River. Situated in the northwestern Democratic Republic of the Congo until 1968, according to Jim Hendricks Jr., Huston saw it and the vessel was temporarily pulled from service for the film. In 1982, late attorney (and Bogart buff) Jim Hendricks, Sr., discovered the vessel languishing in an Ocala horse pasture and purchased the piece of movie history for $65,000. An equal amount of funds was invested to get the boat operational and Hendricks began offering visitors rides in 1983 while the vessel was home ported at Key Largo's Holiday Inn. In 2001, the African Queen's engine broke, was never fixed and yet it remained on display for curious tourists and film buffs to view. Last year, Captain Lance Holmquist and Suzanne Holmquist signed a long-term lease with Jim Hendricks' son to restore and operate the vessel again. The Holmquists have overseen repairs and have taken pains to date it as it appeared in the film. Plans for the African Queen include offering 90-minute canal cruises several times daily and dinner cruises on selected nights, all from the Holiday Inn Key Largo, mile marker 100 ocean-side, on the Florida Keys Overseas Highway. Costs are $39 per person for the daytime cruise, $25 for children under 12 and the dinner cruise is $89 per person, including the meal. Call 305-896-8004.

This is the world we live in, or so we keep being reminded — often when we have allowed ourselves to forget, momentarily, the evanescence of the every day. It is all up for grabs all the time, and ahead of us, as Kunzru writes, "lay only a vast emptiness, an absence. There was nothing out there at all." To confront these ideas is like staring into the abyss. Still, there are hints, whispers, not quite promises but (maybe) patterns, suggesting more at work than meets the eye.

The directors of Spielberg's generation who came up in the late '60s and early '70s, many of them film-school-trained, were the first in America to push their encyclopedic passion for movies right into the forefront of their work. Their rebellion against Old Hollywood was essentially a pose, since directors like John Ford, Howard Hawks and Frank Capra were mainstays of their mindscapes. Old movies functioned for these filmmakers as primary experiences -- touchstones of inspiration -- in the same way that poetry or literature might have functioned for an earlier generation of artists.

And this: "Stereotyping women as only wives and baby-making machines is not fair. But neither is it fair to stereotype men. What does a man need to prove his masculinity? Can a man prove his masculinity by recognizing that women are also gifted by a greater being and that these gifts can be nurtured so that she, too, can make her contribution to the betterment of the human race?"
"I thought, ‘We are missing something here,’ " said Swanson, a marketing director for Dignity Memorial, a network of funeral homes. "Society is finding all kind of ways to memorialize people, but golf is not one of them. True golfers really find meaning in this kind of memorialization."

In the late '60s, during the Johnson presidency, a big shift occurred when he decreed that only wines from the United States would be served in the White House. This tradition has continued ever since, in part because the shift took place at the perfect time in our country's wine history: the beginning of our meteoric rise to excellence in winemaking. Until then, no fine restaurant in New York City (or any other major city) would carry a wine from Oregon or Washington, let alone Arizona. There may have been a Beaulieu Vineyards, "George de Latour" Cabernet Sauvignon or an early Robert Mondavi Reserve, but that was about it.

No one in Congress has been a greater advocate for children's services and youth development. No one has been more knowledgeable about Africa. No one has voted more consistently for peaceful and non-military resolutions to problems. No one has been more consistent in the fight to respect workers' safety and workers' conditions," said Rep. Rush Holt (D-12th Dist.)
That's especially so at the treasury, where minding the store is a must. Periodically -- before the Civil War, before World War I, late in the 1920s, in 1970 and early in the 1980s -- something at Ohio's treasury goes very wrong. And even when the treasurer is personally blameless, that's whom voters blame. If, between anti-Brown campaign stunts, Mandel finds time to stop by the office he was elected to run, he might care to recall that fact.

There's little sign that the billionaire boat boom is ending. The recession has certainly hit the "middle-class" yacht market, as banks cut back on boat loans and mere millionaires struggle to rebuild their fortunes. Orders for boats of more than 80 feet fell to 753 last year from 992 in 2008, according to Showboats International magazine. Yet orders for superyachts, or those more than 250 feet, were actually up more than 20% in 2009, according to Showboats.

Newton said he fully supports Annable, calling him an exemplary representative. "He has been in the business since 1980 and doesn't have one single customer complaint on record," Newton said.
One other factor worked to Obama's and McCain's benefit during the primary season -- a deepening distrust among voters of all ideological stripes toward the Washington political hierarchy. McCain first attempted to run as the candidate of his party's establishment and failed dismally in that effort. It was only after his near-death experience last year that he reverted to the role of outsider and underdog that he began his comeback. Obama's positioning was even more impressive, as he successfully recast Hillary Clinton's message of experience as the ultimate in conventional and traditional politics. Almost one year after the fact, it's still extraordinary to realize that the first plausible female candidate in our nation's history was dismissed as business as usual.
He said he wanted to bring the bond issue total down to $39.9 million, "because we need to keep this bond issue defensible" to voters.
Auditors said they had trouble figuring out what the athletics division was charging against its outside sponsorship income. They complained that financial statements from Nelligan were complicated and poorly detailed, and that expenses were not supported with documentation.

It would seem, having read most of what the paper of record has reported on this sad saga, that Mrs. Love is guilty of what she accuses of others. To wit, at some point in time, after one of her daughter's many brouhahas in Virginia, the two had a long tete-a-tete, then met overnight in Annapolis to discuss the upheavals in Yeardley's life. So, at what point did Mrs. Love have the responsibility to deal with her daughter's aberrant association with Mr. Huguely, for her to speak with the university's athletic director, etc.? Certainly, she was not without knowledge that things were bad or dangerous. Those will be very embarrassing questions for her to answer in discovery in this case.

He forgot about the record until the master tapes, which were thought to have been destroyed in a warehouse fire, resurfaced in the late '90s.

I had two surgeries and needed six chemotherapy treatments. I went back to work but it became more difficult because I became sicker after each chemotherapy treatment.

As with atypical fractures, other serious conditions have occurred in people taking bisphosphonates. Studies support an association between the drugs and osteonecrosis of the jaw, a bone-killing infection often triggered by dental work. The condition is rare — rates of osteonecrosis of the jaw have been estimated at between 1 in 10,000 and 1 in 100,000 — although Solomon, for one, thinks the rate may be significantly higher than that. In addition, the risks of these side effects can be minimized by taking some precautions, such as getting dental work done before starting on bisphosphonate therapy.

New sporting equipment seems to be outdated as soon as it hits the shelves. Advanced technology, improved performance, even the latest color scheme can quickly turn what's hot today into cold tomorrow. And golf clubs are no exception. Trust me, the corner in our garage occupied by my husband's dusty irons drives this point home.

Or you could turn them into a coat rack: My husband's favorite is one I made from unused drivers. He still gets to keep his clubs (well, at least part of them) and I get more garage space for the important things, like flower pots and bags of dirt. It's "fore" the best.

And yet, I am reminded of the words of my grandfather, now 90: "The day you're well enough to live, you're also sick enough to die." Reminded that there's only so much you can do.

There were 139,000 groups in the U.S. with 501(c) (4) tax-exempt status in 2010, the latest year of available IRS data. More than 1,700 organizations applied for that designation in 2010 while over 1,400 were approved.

According to the examples, as written by Elsner, the city can’t work with local, state or federal officials on transit projects, which could include using city facilities like the library to host meetings or have staff attend them or pay for any transit studies required of projects. It also says the city can’t pay for staff or officials to use public transit.

The 550-page paperback is consumer friendly. Readers can explore the risks for developing heart disease in detail or glance at a list of 11 risk factors, some well known and others not so much, such as gum disease and migraines.

"There are no neat or easy answers here," Obama said in a speech in which he pledged anew to "clean up the mess at Guantanamo" that he said the nation had inherited from the Bush administration.
A program's goal should not be to play for a national championship every year -- a program's goal should be to reach its potential every year. For some teams (like Alabama football, UConn women's basketball) it's realistic to set goals of playing for and winning a national championship. But do you really think it's the same at Arkansas State? If Gus Malzahn walked into his locker room and told his players he expected them to play for a national championship, and then they went on to win four games, isn't he just setting them up to feel like failures?

A. I have to say that I was a little cynical at first. But then I realized that we could never do justice to the final book if we tried to do it in one movie. There was just no way. There's far too much plotline. One of the producers said they might not have been able to call it the "Deathly Hallows" because that part would have to be cut from a single movie. That would have been ridiculous. I saw that they were right to split the book.

He coordinates sales of trees through his company Angel Red Pomegranate Inc., and of fruit through one wholesaler, Sunriver Sales, seeking to avoid the overplanting and cutthroat competition that have destroyed the profitability of other promising varieties.

2. The Lakers hardly played much defense. Let's just preface the rest of this analysis by saying the game itself means absolutely nothing. The Lakers already knew they'd face the Denver Nuggets in the first round. Still, it would've been nice if the Lakers actually used this as a practice scrimmage to hone some defensive concepts since it's remained their primary weakness in the last month. Instead, the Lakers simply played the Kings as if they're NBA Jam. Yeah, Mike Brown isn't going to dissect this tape that featured all the Kings' starters cracking double digits and scoring 25 fastbreak points. But this game certainly doesn't help matters either.

This might seem counterintuitive, given that Mexico is in the throes of a real, live shooting (and torturing and decapitating) drug war that has seen the deaths of 12,000 people since 2006. If Mexico has been getting serious about trying to stop drug trafficking and disassemble the vicious cartels that supply drugs, why "send the message" that possession of small amounts of drugs is OK? Doesn't that undermine the larger anti-drugs effort?

Wacky ideas sometimes come to me when I swim laps at Brink Pool. So the other day as I was doing my aquatic workout, I came up with a solution to Pacifica's fiscal follies: Lure a government agency into moving its headquarters to Rockaway Quarry. Okay, I warned you it was a wacky idea! But really, wouldn't all those sweaty civil servants in Sacramento or Washington prefer working in our cool coastal climate? All those disgruntled local politicos who vent at City Council meetings and in the Tribune's editorial pages would sign up to become lobbyists at the new Rockaway government center. Fat-cat bureaucrats on expense accounts would fill our restaurants and motels. The high-speed rail project would extend right to Rockaway so we could stop worrying about widening Highway 1. If you like my pie-in-the-sky idea, call 1-800-FAT-CHANCE.

I read Bernie Miklasz's Wednesday (April 4) column just hours before first pitch. It offered no new facts or hope. But, I didn't need him to tell me it'll be okay. Since December 8th, I've wondered about this season without Albert, Tony and later Dave Duncan. I quit worrying when Beltran was signed, more so when Wainwright threw his first Spring Training game. I have no fears after Lohse taking a no hitter into the seventh, Motte's slider and the Cardinals 13 hits in Miami's lime green stadium.

Less successful were two cured fish dishes. At $4 per, the price was right, but the trout was too salty and the salmon, while tasty enough, was accompanied solely by two triangles of griddled rye bread. It could have used something — a spoonful of creme fraiche, a dab of mustard, even a dill sprig.

DNA evidence doesn't solve these problems — it can only tell us just how bad they are — and it exists in only about 10 percent of criminal cases, far fewer than one would think from watching TV crime shows like CSI.

Hey, Tom: Mark Price, John "Hot Rod" Williams, Carlos Boozer and Mo Williams are just examples of second-round draft picks who played for the Cavs and became stars. The examples litter the NBA.

That Dems wouldn't keep their '08 promises was entirely predictable -- just as they're sure to break this year's vows, too. Why? Because reality rules: To close Gitmo, you need a place for detainees. Taxing even "just" the rich might trigger a double-dip recession. End wiretapping, and you put the nation at risk. Many in the military like "Don't Ask, Don't Tell."

None of this is to say that the U.S. will not continue to be one of the most important powers -- only that its days of first dictating and then guaranteeing the rules are numbered in an era in which it has become a debtor nation.

For a Newsweek cover article about author William Faulkner, Emerson headed to the Nobel laureate's Mississippi home. Though a sign at the driveway told him to go away, Emerson knew Faulkner sometimes relented. He relished telling the story from there, in many variations: how he ventured up the driveway anyway, attracting first dogs and then a shirtless Faulkner himself, who grumbled a few words and then calmly told someone to get his shotgun.

In a healthy economy, the cost of layoffs should be transitory, as workers quickly find new jobs.

This is where we find Allen on the day of the Blazers final home game of this blasted shortened season. I suspect he'll show up, and sit baseline. Or maybe he'll blow off the home finale for something more intriguing. I can't say I'd blame him if he choose to skip the thing.

But if stress persists — or is perceived as persisting — it's a different story. The adrenal glands release another hormone called cortisol, and cortisol increases appetite and may also ramp up motivation in general, including the motivation to eat. Once a stressful episode is over, cortisol levels should fall, but if the stress doesn't go away — or if a person's stress response gets stuck in the on position — cortisol may stay elevated.

There’s something about a prism of sparkling light that fascinates us all. We’re not quite sure what it is, but when we see it dance — the flicker of a glistening diamond, glowing frost-lit icicles, a twinkling star — we are instantly mesmerized.

Like other recently minted teen heartthrobs — Joe of the Jonas Brothers, for instance — Bieber has decided to model his first tentative moves on the grown-up market on those made by Justin Timberlake after his break with *NSYNC. As the last man to escape the boy band cellblock, Timberlake is held in the highest esteem by all young pop stars looking to translate next-big-thing hysteria into a sustainable mainstream career. It’s tough to remember now, but JT was once a "Star Search" hopeful and a charter member of the Mickey Mouse Club. He, like Bieber, was regularly dismissed as prefab lightweight; even in *NSYNC, he was often unfavorably compared to JC Chasez and Lance Bass. Timberlake beat long odds by jumping ship seconds before the boy band revival grew stale — and by hiring hip-hop producers to toughen his sound and to make him sound more adult. The Neptunes worked on his first single; Timbaland and his protégé Nate "Danga" Hills were responsible for most of his big hits. Timberlake let the producers run wild on "FutureSex/LoveSounds," his second disc; not everybody loved the aggressive pop experiments on the album, but it completed the star’s transition from a tyro on puppet strings to an ambitious artist with a long future in the spotlight.

When it comes to this economy, we are also looking for Phil-like prognostications. The monthly unemployment figures, which dropped in January from 10 percent to 9.7 percent, can be read depending on your mood: chilly, because they didn't change that much; or warm and fuzzy, a sign that the economy is picking up.
The 19-page beverage list, which also has excellent house-made cocktails and concludes with a well-honed collection of spirits, is very well chosen.

It was so loud that if I were the mom, it would driven me out of the store in embarrassment. And I also would have tried to find out why my kid was crying in the first place.

When the film moves forward four years to 2003, Camille appears considerably changed. Her long hair is cut gamin short, and she is seriously involved in the study of architecture, though signs of her loneliness are not hard to come by.

Unlike commercial alternatives, Prey is open software. The source code can be downloaded and examined by people much, much more savvy and cynical than you or I. It does use external code modules that aren't part of Prey's core library, but the modules themselves are used by just about everyone, so their behavior and limitations are well understood by the security community. If Prey itself was designed to prey upon its users, that would have been discovered long before now; from that perspective, it's safe.
It wasn't even so much that the bullpen failed again. They're 2-for-5 in save situations and can anyone say that's a surprise? Even under normal circumstances - 34 degrees at game time and a 22-degree wind chill is normal only for an inmate in a Siberian gulag - Jose Santiago and Chad Paronto have not done much to convince anyone that they should be entrusted with leads and ties in the late innings.

Poisonous pufferfish and scorpions aside, sharing oversized drinks on Valentine's Day can be a dangerous game. Get a bad drink and you may not remember the date; share one with a bad date and you'll be stuck for a long time over a big drink.

"To make matters worse, we discovered the bank that took over ours charges a $30 annual maintenance fee when an IRA owner has less than $10,000 in the bank. This fee was clearly spelled out in the terms we received from the new bank. We failed to read them because we assumed they would be similar to those of the old bank. The result is that my wife would have lost money with the IRA because the maintenance fee would have been more than the interest she earned. Fortunately, we discovered the problem before the $30 was due and my wife was able to transfer the IRA money to another institution without penalty.

In 1994, the entire Jack-the-Ripper-themed collection Mr. McQueen produced for his master's thesis was bought by English style icon Isabella Blow—a remarkable feat for a young graduate. She wore the clothes to functions and spread his name. Later, when Ms. Blow dropped by McQueen's store, the designer would pick out something for her to wear and she would take it without trying it on, says Yuliya Zakharenko, who worked at the store for three years. (Ms. Blow committed suicide in 2007, after which Mr. McQueen dedicated his Spring 2008 show to her and included bottles of Fracas, her favorite fragrance, in the gift bags.)

"We receive the movie at a certain moment when it comes out, and when we started working on the movie everyone was more interested in Iraq than Afghanistan, and now I think we are much more interested in Afghanistan than Iraq.

And be prepared to see Dunham, who looks nothing like the women we see in most TV shows. That is to say, she might pass muster as the nerdy gal-pal in a traditional sitcom. But when was the last time we saw the lead female character in a TV show -- comedy or drama -- look so average? Dunham's not skinny. She doesn't appear to have had a nose job, Botox or lip injections. All of her body parts -- and we get a good look at them -- appear to be factory originals.

Providence always has prided itself on being different. The city was founded in 1636 by Roger Williams, after he was booted from the Massachusetts Bay Colony. His crime? Radical thinking, if you consider the separation of church and state a radical idea. That dedication to religious freedom endures. Providence houses the first Baptist Church in America.

But mainly, it's the slow stewing of the vegetables that results in a mellow harmony of flavors. Those whole unpeeled garlic cloves soften and release their perfume without a hint of harshness. Most times the only moisture added is from the greens as they warm.
Through one is the galley kitchen, but it takes a minute to recognize the room's function. The hammered-nickel sink and stainless-steel Viking oven and cooktop are a giveaway once inside. But the space is wrapped in antiqued black cabinetry with twisted steel handles and black granite countertops.

The two allies look increasingly at odds over basic elements of the strategy to fight the Taliban. Widespread Afghan resentment at the presence of foreign troops appears to be rising amid a series of U.S. missteps — from Marines urinating on dead Taliban fighters to soldiers burning Qurans.

Raves about the Purple Palm made me eager to stay at the hotel. Yet I immediately felt out of place with a child in this romantic, fine-dining establishment. One look at the menu with a $29 wild boar entree and a $14 veal marrow appetizer and I sensed trouble. Was there a children's menu? No, the waiter said. Could my son order a hamburger? No, again, but he could have side dishes from the dinner entrees. The waiter offered no guidance when I tried to envision the taste profiles -- or how anyone, including a child, would like such sides as purple Thai rice with the litchi-Merlot-black truffle glacé.

More fusion was in store at Monique Duval's bakery, where she was experimenting with a new starter she had devised. The transplanted Canadian makes such a variety of organic, whole-grain bread that the offerings barely fit on two large chalkboards on the wall. The tours end with lunch at a small, family run restaurant; we ate at Chaya Maya in the heart of downtown, a simple place that specializes in regional Yucatecan dishes made with super-fresh ingredients. Highlights for me were an ambrosial cream of chaya soup and liberal scoops of sikil p'aak on light, crispy tortilla chips.

Too often bipartisanship is equated with centrism or deal cutting. Bipartisanship is not the opposite of principle. One can be very conservative or very liberal and still have a bipartisan mindset. Such a mindset acknowledges that the other party is also patriotic and may have some good ideas. It acknowledges that national unity is important, and that aggressive partisanship deepens cynicism, sharpens political vendettas, and depletes the national reserve of good will that is critical to our survival in hard times. Certainly this was understood by President Reagan, who worked with Democrats frequently and showed flexibility that would be ridiculed today  from assenting to tax increases in the 1983 Social Security fix, to compromising on landmark tax reform legislation in 1986, to advancing arms control agreements in his second term.

Novick is best known for his eclectic pursuit of justice, whether in taking on the Oregon Lottery Commission to collect more money for schools, challenging U.S. Sen.

It's easy to picture Novick getting restless during discussions of, say, off-leash dog areas.
